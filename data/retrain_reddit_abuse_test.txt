I'd tap that and go back for seconds
CLOSE YOUR FUCKING MOUTH!!!!!
Fee fees and scooty puffs/poofs have become part of my normal vernacular. My husband thinks I'm clever and came up with those on my own...whoops.
Well her hips do have like 3 weird curves of fat hanging off of them.
Happens when skin folds onto itself. HAES, amirite?
In order for her to get morbidly fat she'd have to lose weight, which sure as shit isn't gonna happen
awesome- that's my week made :)
I have two of these shirts and nothing to match them. Fuck it, I'm just gonna wear one as a skirt.
I notice this as a waitress. Whenever someone (not just overweight but SHAMU sized) comes into the restaurant to eat, complains they can't sit where they want because they don't fit into the booth and complains about everything from the service to the lighting to the music, etc...How, just HOW can they complain about the food? I highly doubt that you've got high standards for food when you're wearing Wal-mart clothes and are, conservatively, at least 400+ lbs. And yet they complain. Maybe it's because our food doesn't taste like McDonalds but they'll order 3 or 4 things for themselves, complain about the food, eat all of the aforementioned food, and leave a &lt;10% tip. It's not just occasionally but usually.
On any gay dating site: if they whine about how shallow guys are (and possess the MySpace angle) they are very likely to be an obeast. Pretty much the same as anywhere else.
fuck i just lost my appetite
First mistake was drinking at Chilli's

And triple cheeseburgers. You could probably also add extra patties, I'm assuming. Never tried, but I doubt they would say no.
The CompTac holsters are seriously better than anything else I've tried, and I'm one of the people with a cardboard box of holsters I tried that just weren't for me.
Exactly. Cause they'd feel like a fatass if they just ate it themselves. I'm sure Jesus is also involved since it is Good Friday.
Animal cruelty always pisses me off &gt;:(
Isn't there a dedicated sub for fit 2 fat? For easy browsing?
This arm is made of nightmare material.Also, what's "fuck flattering" supposed to mean? At some point, nothing can be flattering anymore
I can completely see this happening down the road
You might as well use a sharpie in that case
Cool story. Tell it again.
It's a dress and to talk shit on newly weds .. obviously you're living a miserable life
Same here. It's just one of those stereotypes I guess.
Looks like a big soft turd
In the golden days, it was hilarious stories about truly horrible people and scooter-bound eatbeasts. But now it's just about anyone who is slightly fatter than they are.
Does anyone else find it ironic there's a "BEST WAY TO VIEW THIS SUBREDDIT" for /r/BodyAcceptance? Shouldn't we just accept it the way it looks now?
Post this on my comment on your thread over at fph discussion and I'll respond.
Mfw "42 million children under the age of 5 were overweight or obese in 2013." How is that even possible?!?!
Oh I knew it was all my fault, but I would tell myself "I'm not THAT fat". Until I realized I was.Then I grew some discipline and stopped being a lazy hog stuffing my face because emotions.I think the lack of personal responsibilty from all the kids raised to think they are special snowflakes who can do no wrong is also a big contributor to the epidemic of planets nowadays. It can't be THEIR fault, because they are perfect the way they are. They have the participation trophies to prove it!(That totally sounded old person.)
Also, Kenneth Cole has some amazing slim fit men's dress shirts. Warning: Not for swoles. I have mediocre biceps (I do maintenance strength stuff, no bulking) and there is still a small amount of armpit/shoulder pinching.
Me too! H&amp;M Men's extra small is the shit :D
She looks like a fag hag trying to be the center of attention with a bunch of hot gay guys.
I've never looked at stretch marks and said, man that gives me a boner. Despite my username, I do not have a boner this time. Love how the letter boxes cover up the fat gut hanging down. Why, did you not think people would find that super duper amazingly sexily attractive?
And she forgot to shopp her arms. They're even bigger in the "after" photo.
I was thinking it was a sootikin (google it), but I should have known it was food. Of course, following my vomittous revulsion at reading this, I suddenly feel better knowing that this twat is lying. There is no way she has a boyfriend or has sex. This is shit she partly made up..although I am sure the part about finding a noodle in her pubes was true, she was probably ashamed to tell the story without adding some made up shit about her getting some.
Down votes. Good. GOOOOD....Let the HATRED flow from your slovenly hooves you jealous nasty fat fucks. I feed from your tears and triggurs.
I just realized what a stupid question that is. Everyone knows hams don't want to read about the romantic exploits of other hams!
The pork they are using must be cheap. That is why it has 47 grams of fat. That alone explains a lot of the calories
That's about the same as killing him.
I have a few wilderness rescue certifications (swift water rescue, Avalanche Safety/Rescue etc.), the first rule in all of them is to not put yourself at risk....because then the big picture gets real fucked up. Hope you got some sense into your colleague. If a planet collapses your knee or severs the femur.....that's not just 6 weeks....What a dumbass.
Next is a cookbook for being primarily a vegetarian.
And no self-awareness
yeah, this picture is pretty well-known
There is hope for me yet, lolOf course these acquaintances are all fat too.
&gt;russia
The left guy?? Are you fucking kidding me? THATS DWAYNE "THE ROCK" JOHNSON SO SOME FUCKING RESPECT!
I pointed out to my best friend the hash tag effyourbeautystandards and he immediately pointed out the hypocrisy and said, "effyourhealthstandards makes more sense". It was gold
Yes, let's not use the word fat. I have a better word, disgusting.
Even so, I think there's still here. Once you put them on the internet they are there forever. So there's that.
I think the fatty edited it later.
Phone application that's a location-based anonymous 180-character-limited Reddit.

That's a strange thing to cum to.
Is number 22 supposed to be a photoshop of Frank Lampard? If so, that's fucking hilarious.
"Why did I decide to come here...?" "I hope it's over soon..." "This would be a pretty sweet time for a meteor to hit us."
I don't know of many that are truly controversial; the only real 'controversial' subs I frequent are this one and /r/childfree, both of which are on the light side of controversy
which is usually a symptom of obesity.Fat womens' vaginas are loose.
Lets not confuse power lifters and ham planets though. You can tell PL usually even though the fat.
I didn't know anyone could actually be "proud" of having a keg like this guy seems to be. I thought the term "keg" was just a coping mechanism, another joke a fat makes at their own expense
I'd pushed her into the tar pit... Damn fences.
I was mostly triggered by the fact that the belt is lime green and it matches none of my clothes... like how can I exercise with a controller belt that clashes with my clothing? Am I not allowed to look cute whilst doing Zumba? I feel so oppressed!
Hey, I can't blame her for that. Who would want to miss out on Gordon Ramsay? That's a once in a lifetime opportunity! Haha.
There is nothing worse than the smell of a hamplanet that doesn't wash all the nooks and crannies.
That thing is fucking vile. Hit it with a rock until it stops twitching.
Banned till proven swole-CAW
I can't breath just looking at that thing.
How we going on that shitlord dating site?
Looks like a blind date horror story picture. If it says" bubbly personality" in the ad don't expect a thin person.
I hope your joking. 155 is my personal max.
Plenty of grow room for moar cuurves.
When your second chin is bigger than your first chin. \justhamplanetthings
You know who ISNT complaining??? The humans who would have been unlucky enough to sit next to his fat ass and get crushed for the whole flight
The weight loss claims of the product are based on non-proven science - IE False advertising:URL
What the hell! That's the grossest (well maybe...) and oddest I think I've seen on here.
Fucking bulking diet :D
i wonder if we can find a way to give reddit gold to wolfram? certainly deserves it for this.
She might think her obesity is 'cute' now....but I bet she'll change her tune when she hits 40 and the medical conditions finally catch up with her.
Pretty height dependant though. A girl who's 5' 8" and lifts is gonna weigh a little more than a 5'3" cardiobunny.
Yeah, gardening is fucking cheap.Or you can go to nearby farmers market for cheap produce.What's so hard for fatties to understand about this?
And she would never turn it down, shes just too damn lazy to make something. If someone won't do it for her she waits until she can get a shit ton on mc donalds
force her to run for three hours straight carrying sticks
Make it machetes because they're going to need to go deep to make it through the blubber layers.
Yes, it is pleased.
You have so much free time you should get a hobby.
I am supportive. They are trying to be healthier (or whatever their reasoning, it still aids them) and that is a plus. They are working on bettering themselves. Always a plus.
I dumped an ex for that very reason. She kept gaining weight and would always complain about it, and would use her complaints about weight gain to fish for compliments from me and got mad if I ever responded by suggesting diet or exercise. I dumped her after she got mad at me for giving her the "wrong answer" and choosing to not serve her decaying self esteem in favor of just telling her the god damn truth. I realized it was time to move on the first time that I closed my eyes and imagined her former thinner self while we had sex.
Ah, the weird pencil-thin beard where the jawline should be. The fat guy calling card. Sort of like their version of the Myspace Angle.
More like a boxing glove
On a recovery day, maybe. I'm trying to get ready for cross season so taking my training super cereal. I might also not have enough momentum to transfer to them. Lot of inertia in that much fat.
You said you don't like cake. The lie detector test determined that was a lie.

No one needs to make fat people feel bad, they all feel shitty and depressed anyway from a problem of *their own making*
If I was stuck next to a fat fuck like that on the plane and couldn't get a different seat, I would seriously hop off and get on the next flight. Don't care if I have to shell out more money and screw up my schedule. Fuck that.
It never gets old. Arnold is awesome.
&gt; I like how he forgives her for cheating thrice (that he knows of) but dumps her for being fat.It makes me wonder if there's more to the story. Maybe she cheated *again* but she wants to make *him* into the bad guy to get sympathy?
Is...is that neck and back fat? I've honest to god never seen something like this before.
In her case I think it was the weight. She was tiny, they were big and heavy and hurt her.
I agree. Let's not associate with the neckbeard redpill dumbasses.
I wear a size large in girls yoga capris. and they are so comfy and still a little big around my waist. I'm 22 female, 5'7" and 125 lbs.
*looks down*Huh, not fat. I also have tits. Must be genetics.
Thanks for your username, it's delightful
500lb grease fire.
She's remembering back to when she was a little calf grazing on the open plain.
What is a fattie hamster called
Thank godThat's at least less depressing than the the one in the treadmill
No, I posted the yak, and instantly someone called me racist. Not everyone on the Internet lies.

Maybe if you drop the "sorry" :D
Looks like it was a fluke*Sorry for snappy-snoo, NYT!*
How do you pronounce it's name? Everytime I try I get "Lame Mily"
This is from a Louis Theroux documentary, By Reason Of Insanity. Where they interviewed people that have been convicted not guilty by reason of insanity. I couldn't find the actual episode so I don't know what other cases they interviewed and is the reason for such a shitty clip.Apparently this guy assaulted an officer on MLK day with the intention of getting shot. The motive, that the incident would garner enough sympathy to get a guy into the presidency because having a black president would be the greatest thing for the country. That poor woman...
just think if someone a little bit shorter than you wore those theyd be a bowling ball
But that's it!!
I know exactly how you feel. I tend to laugh it off though.
If you can be that comfortable on a bus, you sit down too much and you're also probably homeless.
eww the cellulite. Also..why do fatties think the foot turned in stance makes them look cute? They all do it..and its ridiculous. Its the way a little girl might stand.
There has been one or two posts on here fairly recently where her mouth is actually closed. It was weird to see because I thought all that face fat made it physically impossible to close that black hole of a mouth.
You didn't actually ban me bud, try again
It's the "endless CANDY" that gets my giggles giggling.
Yay! She's back!
And he's red eyed and laughing his ass off while thinking about where he can get some serious munchies...
Pass the eye bleach please...
Wat. That advice though.
I never paid attention to that new phenomenon, "everyone get's a trophy" until I joined FPH and did a lot of reading. So do I understand how that applies to being an Eatbeast? Yes. I get the connection verily. Mediocrity. Everybody has to aim for it.
Props to you, that should've been the title
Its so stupid. You can't fake confidence, because self confidence comes from accomplishing things. Faking confidence without accomplishment makes you the emperor with no clothes.
You lost weight, great good for you. Good for you for doing something you should already be doing. Also nice job breathing.
**Thin is NOT a privilege.** Therefore the argument of whether it's earnt or not IS sheer idiocy. Same way as having a full set of functioning limbs or nervous system is NOT a privilege. It's the default state of *normal*. Those who are without (either by birth or by accident, but hardly ever by choice) are *disadvantaged* but not *oppressed / underprivileged*. It's since that SJW "ableism" bullshit spread on the internet that such nonsensical terms as "thin privilege" exist.
Come on dude, rule 2.
That is one of my favorite lines. I like to say that about parties that fatties show up to.
fukin casul
&gt; although I am overweight, but I'm not at the point that they are.Even their fucking leader has the "I'm not as fat as that one" mentality. Holy shit, she just shits all over them and they still love her.
Usually keeps their food addiction at bay. Not working well for her though.
There's some [stiff competition](URL
Now that I think about it, that's probably the problem. I have elite status so I tend to fly first or toward the very front of the plane. I see so many cute young guys who get on but then pass my seat.
Dont you know ?They simply stack pizzas over and over till they fill a Full quader box.
125 lbs per leg maybe
Come back when normal, fatty
In fact with close inspection of the pictures, 2009 wasn't so bad at least she stopped the progress and in the second half of 2009 it seems that she even managed to lose some weight during the autumn compared that picture from July to December. After that she once again let her self go and it has been just downhill since then. She didn't even seem to lose any weight for her marriage like most brides do.
It does. But in moderation, it can be tasty.
"Someone needs to tell them that the fish has gone bad."- Blind Walmart shopper
If she had been a man he would be in prison for 20 years and it would've made the news and he would get raped in prison and etc.Either way child abusers are going to hell.
Yeah, that's pretty common in any trendy restaurant like Friday's or Applebee's. I always sit on the edge of the seat.
It's like the obeasts are slowly replacing/reprogramming key citizenry with their own kind to further their "fat positive" policy agenda. Like pod people only literally shaped like pods. We are truly developing into a ham planet.
Good thing they have that v8 nissian I guess. I v6 might clonk out
All I kept hearing was mooooo mooooo. Might be funny if someone dubbed cow sounds over the dialog.
Are those knees under all of that blubber? How do they not shatter!I'd love to hear from a reformed eatbeast about the difference in walking. No way can that hting not be in pain.
Not to mention the shitty attitude and values they're teaching todays youth.
So we'll remove the cause.(I always want to say 'clothes' thanks to the lines we yelled for years every Friday overtop of the actual movie)
If she lives that long. Her arteries may not be able to handle the strain of a single, extra task.
stop taking the content away from FPH... :(
Read some comments down. I said recently for the sake of the joke :p
Judging by her own body, this is either patronizing or condescending. In any case, it's hypocritical.
No, cardio doesn't make you fat. Using cardio as an excuse to eat does.
Bet she has a great personality, tho!
Obvious troll is obvious.

Ah. I'm majoring in journalism at uni, looking to get into radio, but I have to say court reporting for print appeals to me too. I did a couple of court stories for my media law unit and loved it.
No use to me. Not that I'd have invested in junk food shares but now they're struggling and desperately rehabbing their menus and brands to keep the share prices up. Still a waste. Oxygen theives they are.

What the fuck? I've been down on my luck before, but the last thing I thought was "Oh man I'm broke, so I can't afford sex toys!". Yes, an active sex life is important to one's general mental health, but orgasms are one of the few things in life that are ACTUALLY FREE.
Well, nice one.
All heil Germany! (Too much? I mean, I love Germany.)
Its ridiculous. Its hard enough taking care of the needs of 7 highly dependent people. Adding one more, especially one that is really dependent for EVERYTHING, can take a lot of time from the other residents, time needed to help them get to the toilet, help them into bed, brush their teeth, and all the other shit that fully able bodied people might take for granted. Its fucked up, man.
Fatty loaded rail gun. Look at the damage a decent sized aluminum chunk can do and imagine what 600 pounds of mass could do when it's traveling at Mach 7.
Just remember, if the hams DID meet the guys, I'll bet you they'd be shocked and angered they weren't all Adonis McBiceps.
I've never seen ripped clothes in dressing rooms. Then again, even the most delusional ham won't try on a 00.
Ayy bb u wan sum fuk?
Glad I'm not alone... idk what I'm supposed to be noticing. Is this her gaining weight in reverse?
OH. MY. GAWD.
Goddamn, I lost almost 50 pounds in 4 by dieting and exercise. She must think ranch dressing is "plant based" or some shit. Lean protein like fish and chicken and lots of greens you dipshit.

+1 for mountain biking. I fucking love mountain biking, along with general cycling and longboarding.
20 min run every other day.45 min cardio every day, followed by about 15 min of ass workouts.
Fat pride...but let's take a picture from an angle that minimizes the fat. So pathetic.
But...how does she hoist herself in and out of the dumpster?
I was socially awkward as a teenager. I mean, I did play three sports and had lots of friends, but I was also a book worm and really shy around girls. I thought if I used big words I could impress them.I later learned, in college, that a quick wit and some humor was far less creepy and actually worked. But I wasn't fat, just shy. So when I goy real attention from the opposite sex I out grew this. I was married to an Eastern European bombshell until very recently, but that's a different story.Long story short, they're just as shy and insecure as I was when I was 16, but kept it going until their mid thirties.
I dream of a time where obeasts are hunted for sport. Would be a short time because if there is one thing obeasts don't do that is run.
Beauty is subjective
Ironically, it's easier to achieve Barbie's figure.
Depends on your activity level. It's ski season, and my Basis Peak has me burning between 6,000 and 8,000 every day that I go to the mountain. 2000 calories is what I typically burn without doing any real exercise.
I need fat hate because vanity sizing is a thing.I hate going to a store, finding out I have to go down sizes and the cut of the clothing is meant for ladies with a gut that juts out as far or further than their chest.Just like men who are tall seem to have shit selection in jeans if they're not overweight.
Whatever floats your boat
"'I'm gay': Mika has finally confirmed he's homosexual after opening up in a new magazine interview"  The fatties finally had a man openly singing about how 'beautiful' they are and he's gay. This tickles my fancy.
I know what they are. Don't like 'em. But even then, 10 of them in one go. Lordy.

Wow. Seriously didn't realize that simply existing, as I am, could be harming others. Nothing that I do, not the resources I use, not the actions I take, not a single thing under my control, only the fact that I EXIST, hurts others. I guess I'm sorry the natural order of things hurts your feelings?

Ew! You were talking to it!

I've only known a few people with actual large breasts. Most "look at my huge ta ta's" just have fat disgusting chest fat sacks. A large breasted friend of my wife got them reduced as soon as she was done feeding her children with them. Large breasts are not the boon fatties would like the world believe.
In complete honesty, how is this thing even still alive?
Not anyone's girl I should hope...
The Logic is fat.
Is that Jeremy Clarkson ?
.... My brother smokes cigarettes and he eats a bag of chips and a can of soda a day. My best friend smokes a pack a day and he eats a breakfast from McDonald's and that's it. They are both extremely skinny. Every person I've met who smokes is skinny. Now how did this person manage to accomplish such a feat...is beyond me.
That 3rd picture scared me too much. I couldn't go on.
&gt; "You don't have to change a single thing*&gt; You don't have to try try try try-y-y*"*Unless you're overweightNecessary addition to the lyrics
*Overweight, biracial, pansexulal, woman*Well here you go, here is your special snowflake badge, wear it with pride.
"Fit". It was more average2fat.
They make 30" bands so they should fit me, but not as well as other brands fit on me like Freya, Panache, or Fantasie.
She was 19 when she and my dad married, I was born almost exactly a year later (off by 3 days) when she was 20. She had my brothers in her late thirties and my sisters (the two youngest) were from my dad (he's 56, his wife is in her early forties)
The funny thing is, everything on FPH is true, meanwhile everything on tumblr is complete and utter lies. Yet somehow we're the baddies?
I'm sure there was plenty of us who were already subbed to that reddit before we seen the post, it's a pretty popular subreddit you know?
Yeah a few hundred above her BMR, but not 3000. 17lbs gained = 59500 calories / 30 days (she said about a month) = a 2000 excess per day.
She kinda looks like a toothpaste tube rolled up from the bottom
Her chin is in the middle of her face. How fucking disgusting.
&gt;Like seeing double......the body weight on a single person's frame? Yes, that what the picture on the right is.
She will die soon. Her body can't put up with that
The puppies look like they're suffocating from the smell.
She's single, guys.
They love to throw around meaningless statistics"2/3 of women in America who have PCOS are overweight!!"Well...2/3 of total American women are over weight, meaning the PCOS has nothing to do with it
I highly recommend fatties do that. We need a steel table though. They can smash their heads till their brain matter pops out.
Time to turn the tables and make gross comments about girls wanting heavy cream not skim watery semen. Start posting shit like that with the fatacceptance and related tags on tublr and Twitter.
Bahaha! I cracked up at my work desk at this.
I look like a straight up bleached saltine lol Working in a place with mostly black lights and other colored lights (a club), I was joking with a customer about how I'm so white I just reflect whatever light is showing on me like a chameleon trying to blend in.

Lmfao yea. I mean I love this sub anyways, its like a fun little^teehee thing to do in my spare time or between writing sentences for my papers. Him being fat is forever.
She's changing beauty standards like...Westboro baptist church is changing religion,Christian Rock is changing metal,and Social Media is changing the internet.They're definitely changing things, but not for the better.
Looks like I lost the link. Sorry bruh. ):
I gave up on gyms a long time ago, and bought a squat rack for home. The privacy is wonderful. At the gym, a few men would try to start awkward conversations but mostly let me be. Women, though, especially in the locker rooms, all made nasty comments and the GLARES I got, holy shit.
That forehead wrinkle is a clear indication that she's trying to slim her face.
smashing the patriarchy so hard, man
It could be a full body shot.Yeah, it could get worse. Much, much worse *shudders*
Have these *people* no shame?
I'm so sorry for you if any of this came back to your family or friends.
Man, I wish there was a shaming feature in the comment sections of these sites that posted an average meal for these awful cows when they shame perfectly normal people. I mean, the NSA already knows what were doing, might as well use it for good.
...is that...no...Berta Lovejoy?
Oh hell OP, I sincerely can't tell if it's real. Maybe a fine idea to reblog to tumblr under effyourbeautystandards honormycurves and bodypositivity
lol. He/she/it/something mad.
At this point, further in all directions a compass can provide, and more
My first reaction when her face appeared was, no joke "HOLY JESUS YOU ARE FAT". No wonder she disabled comments and ratings for her video
crazy deja vu. If only her fate could be the same.URL
I assume cause you're not verified ;)
It's sad. That attitude of needing a relationship and being desperate will mean you will be FA.. goddamn.
They already steal other people's money by making flight costs rise through higher fuel consumption. What makes you think they'll voluntarily defer their own additional costs?
Shes the blondes best friend. Its funny going to bars with them. The blonde gets hit on constantly and it pisses the whale off so much.
I've been vegan for a long time and in high school I had a morbidly obese friend who wanted to lose weight. He decided to go vegetarian, but the problem was he didn't eat vegetables. He lived off of grilled cheese, French fries, pizza, pasta, and any other deep-fried vegetarian junk that got sucked into the black hole that was his mouth. I tried telling him he wouldn't lose weight by eating like that and he insisted that because he was vegetarian he would lose weight. He couldn't even stand watching people eat vegetables. There was one time when I was over his house with another friend and we were eating salads that we bought before we came over there. He started gagging at the kitchen table and ran to the bathroom and threw up. When we asked him what was wrong he said he was too grossed out by watching us eat vegetables. He lasted only a few months being vegetarian and then went back to being omnivorous, but he gained a lot of weight while on his unhealthy vegetarian kick.
Senpaii
If they didn't give her free food I bet she'd be at the money factory bright and early.
That's a remarkably flat ass for someone of her BMI.
I see. I guess I would fall into that category. Alcohol = poison!
To the OP: I love you.
Even in that scene of the movie, the fat guy was expressing admiration of the fit physique.
I'm just going to assume you're an 19 year old pre-cocaine Lindsey Lohan and not a gay dude. Not that gay dudes are bad. Lol
I actually got verified right away because I told them my main account was verified but I'd rather use a throwaway.
Sounds like CPS needs to step in here. What they're doing is child abuse and/or neglect.
That's the kind of sweatshirt that girls want really loose. I'm usually a medium, but I order extra large on sweatshirts like that. Large/XL/2XL always sell out first with those, no matter what's written on it.
Yea that was my first thought - at 5'11 normal starts at 174 for me, so 160 is well into the normal range, though not quite in the middle, as the low end is around 132.
That's some lack luster weed
well, for starters, you gotta get rid of every ounce of self-respect you may have. next, make sure you eat nothing but pure fucking garbage and never, ever move. you'll notice this lady has forgotten her motorized scooter. big mistake. that type of oversight puts her in danger of one day looking like a human
Doing the shitlord's work.
Somewhere, some fat fuck is sitting there reading these comments nodding to himself thinking "Yup, just as I thought"
Well /r/investing will always push you to vanguard. And /r/vpn will always push users to privateaccessinternet.
Wait, she's proud of this?
I actually don't mind these posts. Remember - food is an addiction. If you saw a headline like, "I went a week straight without sucking dick for crack" you could say the same thing about that as you do about not going to McDonalds for a week. I'd say the average person neither goes to McDonalds at least once a week *nor* do they suck dick for crack, but I think not sucking dick for crack is a pretty big step in the right direction, so don't shit on it. For every 400lb lard ass who loses a staggering 7 pounds a month there's probably another 100 gaining 7.The posts that drive me *batty* are the "I'm going to's". I fucking hate that shit. I love my wife, but she's an "I'm going to" person. She's *always* going to do *something* and then mysteriously, weeks go by and it never gets done. Maybe that makes me overly sensitive, but fuck - if you're going to do something, do it and then show me the results. Don't tell me you're going to do something. IMO, that's a promise, and if you break it, you're worse off than if you had just kept your fat fucking mouth shut."Today I begin my journey!" Yeah, right. Because we're all so accountable to strangers on the fucking internet. *~~eye~~ ~~fat~~ eye roll*
Smoking is sweet though BTW
Haha a fucking tank as a skirt. What an animal.
"As soon as the bench cracked underneath me, I knew my weight was a problem."Really? That was your first fucking clue?
And this is fatpeoplehate, where we post pictures of fat people. If you're a fat people, you can always hit me up for free personal training. But you definitely don't belong on this sub.
&gt;GTFOGood one. It is you who will now be GingTFO.

Til then, beat it, fatty.
50% of the time it's the same everytime
25 and up is considered overweight but if you don't have much muscle I'd say the cutoff is more like 23, especially if you're a girl.
Uh, personal experience indicates it's very true. Are you being sarcastic?

I'm a nurse and I refuse to help planets get up it sit up. If they ask me for my arm I show them the bed rail and that I'm no physically able to pull them up. If you can't sit your fat ass up cuz you treat your mouth like a garbage can , I'm not breaking my back or shoulder on you. Good on you for protecting yourself.
It looks like a storage facility?
Because each thinks it's "not as fat as" the other
At that rate she will just blow up in a year or two... But yea... $$$ MONEY BUY **THINGS** $$$
I love your hateful description, but it makes me angry knowing that the people you've described actually exist.
Look at her fupa at 3:07. It looks like it has its own beating heart...
its not there for a sandwich it's there for 5 bags of chips and 18 cookies!
That was the worst thing I have ever seen.
From the fat? Or other problem?
This is why I hate fat fucks. I had a close family member die. This cousin was fit and would have been a shitlord if they lived long enough for FPH on reddit. Why the fuck did someone who lived healthy get taken away while these disgusting fat fucks roam the Earth barely hanging on to life. When you get so big you need a scooter to move around, because you cant stop eating, your right to live should be revoked.

For a second, I thought there was a penis. I'm on mobile though, so I guess that's a good excuse.
These people seriously need help. Wtf!
If its about midgets then I'll support it any day. But it's not. :c
I see she's gearing up for Movember.
And denial.
Exactly. That's what happened to me. Good plan for him, it totally worked - for years. I have a tendency to become completely creeped out by any older person who specifically only dates younger partners. It makes me think they're likely an abuser, enjoy having a dependent who can't easily get away, and, in the best light, no one their own age is willing to deal with their shit so now they go after young ones who don't know better.
*Somebody saaaaaaave me!* For some reason the song from Smallville came to mind.
I support this, if all the hams swarm to one place then I won't have to look at them in other bars/restaurants.
i had the same thought.
yes, caliper bodyfat tests are more accurate but are mildly humiliating and impossible to perform on the morbidly obese. BMI is accurate enough for deathfats.
I love reading things here. It makes losing weight all the easier.
Seriously... My friend has PCOS is she is a true shitlord at 5'2 and 102lbs and doesn't miss a day of gyming even when she's sick. People will find excuses for anything.
"A little extra". Didn't bother reading his profile.
"African-American" is accurate, since it refers to Americans of African descent. "Big-boned", however, is bullshit.
This will be reddit history. AND I WAS HERE READING IT.Great story :)
Kind of funny that even a 1/4 ton pickup would be over capacity in this case.
Like anyone at Jezebel would write anything even remotely responsible about women overeating. Just too easy to talk about starving women so that their fat reader base feels comforted.
5 mins training??? Is this a joke?
I love Tony and his videos, but the problem is he always emphasizes that he wants you to push yourself, but only do what you are able to. Shitlords know what that means, but fatties who have never had to push themselves to do anything before just don't.There is no way she was actually doing the whole tape - let alone seriously pushing herself, she'd get two reps in for each set then stop and rest for the remaining 90 seconds of the exercise. She may have watched all the videos for 90 days, but there was obviously no dietary change or serious participation in the workouts. Pathetic. This is why they say they've 'tried everything and can't lose any weight.' They figure that if they are working out (their version), then they don't need to make the commitment to changing their diet.
Mmm. Your recipes intrigue me!
Eww
If you're a smoker, you pay higher insurance premiums. I think the same should be said of obesity, too.
They keep telling themselves that because they think it will make it true.
Can confirm. Was fat, tried to help. Fuck fatties.
I can barely pick out where the rib cage is supposed to be, the only thing that looks relatively... Uh... Recognizable is the intestines.. and even those look like the person they belong to has been dead for 4 or 5 days. Edit: Dead for 4 or 5 days. In the sun. In Florida.
I look up to my mom for maintaining a life like this. She was a marathon runner and crazy 80's aerobics lady. Because of her active lifestyle, she was in and out of the hospital for all 3 pregnancies in under 3 hours. She taught "power hour" at the YMCA at 5 am the entire time she was pregnant with me. She dropped me off at the Y's daycare the week after she had me to start running again. She is 54 and still runs 5 miles every morning and then hot yoga after work (and sometimes the gym too). We were raised with no salt or butter on the table, no shitty food, etc. She has always maintained being 5'3 and ~120 lbs.
Fucks with proper squat mechanics. You need quad accessory work in your training.
That's fucking vile! Please tell me that was just a troll...that's not real.. (Please?)
Why do fat people enjoy having like seven asses around their body
it's hard to watch, but remember: those shaky old ladies are getting excercize (physical exercise as well as practice) that they really do need, and those lardbeasts have less time on earth than the diligent old ladies do.
I eat all the time....but I don't eat McBeetus all the time. A nibble here, a nibble there and one or two high cal meals. I also can't sit still for long periods of time which helps too. Oh and I drink water.
It would be awesome if they took these studies on board but don't forget their special snowflake status will make them think they are the 1%.

Even if you're not lactose intolerant, cheese-free pizzas can be really good. I know a place that does a vegan pizza with hommus drizzled on top instead of cheese, and it's delicious. It leaves you feeling a lot less heavy and slow afterwards compared to normal pizzas too.

What in the fuck did I just watch.
&gt;Maybe I don't need wellbutrin, maybe I just need Synthroid..___.Why do so many people (esp fatties) think their mental health problems *must* be related to their thyroid? There's even people on r/hypothyroidism who have claimed Synthroid made them suicidal. No, you're mentally fucking unstable.

&gt; probably post-menopausal women... Do they gather fat at their stomach insteadYes. The understanding is post-menopausal women estrogen levels drop, testosterone levels increase and there is a trend to deposit fat in areas similar to man-style - mid-section, love handles.Funny thing, men who have a large mid-section tend to also have a large amount of visceral fat, which likes to do funny things like spit hormones out in the body... even turn testosterone into estrogen... and then those men may deposit fat in areas similar to woman-style - hips, legs, moobs, bingo arms.
Seriously. Watching close friends and family eat themselves into an early grave, and now having something that justifies the life style so they never get healthy. I didn't used to hate fatties. I cared. Until this HAEs and fat acceptance started. The blatant hypocrisy is far too much for me to handle.

I can't speak for the other branches (specially the army with some of their fat fucks that I've seen) but at least with the Marines you can't get in, regardless of how big your neck is, unless you meet regular (non-taped) BMI criteria when you first apply, and are able to do 6 pull ups, run 1.5 miles in less than 11 mins, and at least 60 crunches in 1 min. Once you are in, it is possible for you to gain weight and get away with it through taping, but you are still required to take yearly PFT's (Physical Fitness Test) and CFT's (Combat Fitness Test). And if you can't pass either because you're out of shape or because you've gotten fat, then that is enough grounds to get kicked out. Now none of this really applies to me (5'11, 145lbs, 7% bf) but I just brought it up to make the point that even though that fattie is just being a butt hurt catfish, the BMI can in some occasions be skewed when it comes to heavily muscled individuals who have inherited big necks (people of samolian decent tend to be a great example of this).
The sad thing is that I still wouldn't call my diet all that "good." I just don't eat monstrous amounts.

Damn, how do you put yourself through that. The smokes I mean. I only have a couple minor health complications from my mother smoking during pregnancy, and I loathe and despise cigarettes.

Uuuugh. I wish we were allowed to link to their tumblrs. I'd give this black hole a piece of my mind. I don't care if you wanna kill yourself with fatness. Just stay out of my sight. But when you do that to a fucking pet? That is LOYAL and TRUSTS YOU? That's jusy pathetic. Die.

&gt;As she is fitted to her wedding dress...Even ignoring generic "lol fatties", the wedding dress is fitted to the body.
Mattresses do absorb dead skin, dead bugs, sweat, and other odors over the years. Still, 2300 lbs of capacity takes quite a lot of weight or filth to overwhelm.
That is so rude. It's really hard to just move those things if they are outside. You have to ride them because they're fairly heavy.
We're not trying to, but we just might. Remember that article of a ham losing X tons because a shitlord threw his drink at what should have been her face and said she was disgusting?But hey, that would be a world where fatties stop making excuses, have self control, are not useless animals... and that's just not gonna happen.
Seriously though, when he talked about how Matt wanted him to feel ashamed and lose the weights, I was so emotional... Then he pulled the it's not my fault and we ain't friends anymore
My Asian mother shitlorded me to lose weight as well. If it bothers him that much then losing weight would be the only way to make it stop. Instead he wants to be a whiny bitch about it.
Sexualizing minors? What?
Thin privilege is shitting blood ;_;Although you'd think she'd see a doctor if she had symptoms of UC.

Fyi OP, fatties will claim that that quote is false. It is actually a condensed/paraphrased version of this, written down by Xenophon, not Plato as most of Socrates usually is. &gt;I tell you, because military training is not publicly recognized by the state, you must not make that an excuse for being a whit less careful in attending to it yourself. For you may rest assured that there is no kind of struggle, apart from war, and no undertaking in which you will be worse off by keeping your body in better fettle. For in everything that men do the body is useful; and in all uses of the body it is of great importance to be in as high a state of physical efficiency as possible. Why, even in the process of thinking, in which the use of the body seems to be reduced to a minimum, it is matter of common knowledge that grave mistakes may often be traced to bad health. And because the body is in a bad condition, loss of memory, depression, discontent, insanity often assail the mind so violently as to drive whatever knowledge it contains clean out of it. But a sound and healthy body is a strong protection to a man, and at least there is no danger then of such a calamity happening to him through physical weakness: on the contrary, it is likely that his sound condition will serve to produce effects the opposite of those that arise from bad condition. And surely a man of sense would submit to anything to obtain the effects that are the opposite of those mentioned in my list.&gt;Besides, it is a disgrace to grow old through sheer carelessness before seeing what manner of man you may become by developing your bodily strength and beauty to their highest limit. But you cannot see that, if you are careless; for it will not come of its own accord.Mmm Socrates. The original shitlord.

I've recently started to feel like my current girlfriend is *the* girl, and this comment really resonated with me. For the first time in my life, I've talked with someone about having kids and this is absolutely the type of parent I want to be. I don't want to be a huge hambeast who can't do anything more than kick a ball once or twice before sitting back down on the park bench, I want to be the dad who can take the kids to the park and play soccer and run around for as long as they want. Sorry, I know this is a little sappy for this sub, but your comment really made me think, so thank you.
&gt; ...I didn't want to actually make her feel bad (despite the deception), so I went with it. All men are enslaved who serve things evil.

Good, fuck them, FPH is getting famous and that's a good thing. Also OP, if you have another gym option you should definitely go there. It's worth the price difference and you don't have to deal with the bullshit rules banning anything that hurts the fees fees of butter trolls. hamPlanet Fitness is a marketing ploy, they profit off fat asses that use the gym once every few months.
There are plenty of home workout dvds that will keep him fit (p90x, insanity, t25 and the like). I don't do well with exercising outside when it's freezing. During the winter, these are my go-to.

Not moving, totally enthralled by the TV. Yup, that's every fatty I've ever seen in a gym.
This is unbelievable. I even checked at FotoForensics and it is legit. Wow. Just wow. Have you ever been so fat that you looked shopped?
I really don't enjoy any posts of just regular fatties just fatting around. If they're doing something especially point and laugh worthy or are especially enormous, that's fine, but "Look, here's someone who is 20 lbs overweight standing in walmart" just doesn't rustle my jimmies
Yeah that totally happens.
That poor dog will end up getting no exercise and obese, just like the owner.

&gt;I mean it's not like we can give thyroxine and make them euthyroid is it??This. Thank you. Someone that actually knows how it's treated. I don't get why it's blamed for weight gain so much either; it stands to reason that if you know you have it, you've seen a doctor for that diagnosis. If you've seen a doctor, you're being treated. Therefore, you can lose the weight you gained before dx and tx and shouldn't be able to blame your weight on it unless you were very recently diagnosed--and even then, you'd be working your ass off to lose that extra weight. I also love how they blame PCOS on obscene weight gain. I have it and so does half the women in my mother's side of the family, and we're all a normal healthy weight. With the exception of a couple FA cousins, anyway, but fuck em. I've got over 30 first cousins on that side of the family so I can pick and choose which ones I want to associate with.

This happened to me the only time I stepped foot in a Chick-Fil-A. They don't have them within 300 miles of where I spend 99% of my time, so it was easy to walk away and never look back. Killed three birds with one stone: didn't support fat-producing company, didn't get fatter, didn't support anti-gay bullshit.
I believe it. My dad and father in law have become quite dull and slow over the years.
The fat seems to be real... gross
The reason they put a weight limit on cars is to cover the ass of the manufacturer. it's about avoiding lawsuits because a 300+ pound fatty will pit over a half ton of force on a seat and seat belt in a crash in some cases ripping the seat free from it's rails. It's got nothing to do with what your stupid aftermarket coil overs and springs are capable of supporting.I hate fatties, I love motorsports, and I hate idiot boy racers almost as much as I hate fatties
No,I was overweight back when I was 10 but I didn't talk about how I accepted it like every hamplanet today,because I didn't want to be fat and I took it to myself to get fit,I joined a fencing club and went there for a while until I wasn't fat anymore,I actually saw allot of people there doing the same thing.We cheered on eachother to get better physically and mentally.Hamplanets today aren't even trying to get fit,they talk about accepting obesity wich blinds so many people into thinking they are happy.I don't accept that kind of shit.I don't care if they want to be fat but don't take it out over other peopleThey*Make people think it's healthy to be fat*make bad impressions on young people*take up a shit ton of our tax money just so they can keep on being fat*actively seek out "anorexic" people to send death threaths to them.Fuck,fat,people.

My doctor tells me to take off my shoes? But maybe 2 lbs on 90-95lbs means more than on someone 200lbs?
Go karts also come in fat version?!? Holy Hell!! If one more ham is going to complain society hate fats show it this picture ... I'm at loss of words ...
Well I'm tired of this drama. People are mad, but they need to build a bridge and get the fuck over it. This is just oh-so-typical reddit behavior. People get all worked up in surges one way or the other and then when they get a little egg on their face, start calling for blood.
This doesn't take any skill or talent. Anybody can eat unhealthy food and never work out and balloon up to this size. This isn't indicative of anything other than her being unhealthy and lazy. Why are people rewarding this? If some person spends a lot of time eating healthy and going to the gym 5 times a week, are they aloud to do the same thing? I mean, if they did it would make sense. They would be showing off their hard work. This isn't showing off anything.
Unfortunately there isn't anything grotesque enough that it can be fairly compared to a fatty. So we make due with what we've got.
It is a legal way to kill them.
I know! That's right up there with lying on the internet! People don't *actually* do that. Right?
Yup! Even smarter than me! One time, I was stress eating because my exams are coming, so I was eating a pack of Oreos and he walked in my room and saw me indulging Oreos and drinking Gatorade then told me "Why are you eating too many, you're going to die from diabeets (he cant pronounce diabetes though)." I immediately stopped eating too much sweets when studying.
Sounds like you could be the first. Trailblazers always catch a ration of shit, that's how you know you're right.Do your best and actually state that you had extreme difficulty finding any relevant papers to cite. Include the journals you searched. Your instructor might have some insight into other possible sources. Good luck!
I would be interested to hear just what the fuck exactly he thinks feminism is. Dumbass.
That comparison is not even remotely parallel.

Thats Pearchan, aka Beccabae. Knew it was only a matter of time before she turned up here. Encyclopedia Dramatica has a file, if you'd care to read.
It looks like the opposite of bowlegged. I assume it's from the pressure of supporting so much mass. It might be more pronounced in fatties who grew up fat.
The only thing that is worse than a ham, a ham that harms those around themselves.

Fuck, that vile, putrid, hamplanet of a gluttonous waste of Earth's resources is going to be within 300 miles of me.* The energy saved from flying that excess fat across the Atlantic could probably power an African village for a year. The jet fuel could have be burnt in planes aiding the study of global climate change in the arctic and resupplied an Antarctic Ice station. The space she takes up could have allowed 2 students to do a foreign exchange. * The food she'll eat just in this trip could feed a family for 6 months. The revenue from the food she'll consume will go into bland commercial chains instead of supporting local business by buying high quality but low volume produce from independent retailers. The vast quantity of food she'll consume will put pressure on our sewer infrastructure and her taking a crap will risk the structural integrity of any toilet she shits/sits on - this additional maintenance cost will be absorbed by our tariffs whenever anyone else stays.* The fabric needed just to cover her body could provide emergency shelters for Syrian refugees.* The publicity she has and magazine space she occupies could be taken up by science, culture, arts, literature, economic/political explanations for the upcoming election, promotion of worthy causes.* The vapid, empty, soulless bitching she'll do about comments on Instagram and Reddit will lower the already low IQ's of obeasts and hams in the UK to the point where they'll reach single digits. By this point, they're at risk of slipping on their own gormless drool, require additional medical care therefore taking up doctors appointments, put unrequired strain on the NHS and increase the nations drug bill. * The clothes she promotes will get fat women who already have limited budgets to buy bikinis in Britain in a country where you may only need a bikini once a decade for a fancy dress party with a Hawaiian theme because where else in the UK would you be fat and wear a fucking bikini??**EDIT** The thing that gets me most about this buttergolem is not the effyoubeautystandards bullshit where fat vapid women can tell themselves that their cottagecheese legs are sexy, it is more the effyouhumanityandfucktherestoftheworld approach to life of screw the consequences of over consumption personified in one vile, morbidly obese and arrogant women.

Thankfully, it'll be ridiculously easy to call bullshit on them if they do, since PWS has fairly obvious physical deformities that go along with it.

Who cares? No one, not even the fatshits believe it.
My grandma is also a huge shitlord! My mother and her husband are both obese and when ever my grandma is around she's **constantly** on them about what/how much they're eating. It pisses my mom off, but what the hell else should your mom do as she watches you eat yourself to 400lbs.
It sucks that he bogarted your donut, but it made for an excellent tie in to FMJ.
This is so ridiculous!Says she barely eats... even though she has been hiding and sneaking food since she was a child.Says she doesn't smell, when she has sores and lumps leaking fluid, and she's too big to roll over in her bed. How can she cleanly use the bathroom?How incredibly delusional.
Fucking fatass animal doesn't deserve to wear clothes like a normal human being.
I actually do this. Whether it's a thumbs up, a nod and smile, or an actual compliment. It makes me feel better to know other humans exist at normal proportions.It helped me overcome my extreme social anxiety.
Just a cautionary note, as a minimalist runner I dont recommend running more than half a mile in minimalist types of shoes. Like, you have to build distance a lot more slowly than just jumping into a pair of super supported sneakers. Your feet become weak being in a supported shoe and need a lot of time in order to strengthen.
I think it's funny that a few months ago all these hams were so excited for Lily to be at Target and now they want to call all their clothing ugly.
Probably because of the lunk alarm, kicking people out who they deem to be "too fit", removing free weights and weight machines in favor of cardio machines, giving their members candy and pizza, and the fact that they participate in a large amount of fit/thin shaming. Nothing they do actually encourages their members to take control of their lives and become fit.Just do a search for "what's wrong with Planet Fitness" and you'll find lots of stories.If it works for you, no problem, but be careful because if you grunt because you are exerting yourself, or wear a sleeveless shirt, or someone decides that your physique is making them uncomfortable, they will kick you out.
That's physically impossible for her, there's just too much fat. Or her arms are simply too short that is also possible..... HAHAHAHAHA no of course not
No kidding! And let me tell you, if she is just slightly overweight now, she will gain 100 pounds and blame it on having kids! Even if you dump her, 10 years from now when you go to pick up your kid for a weekend visit with your new skinny wife in tow, your new wife will look at her and say "you fucked that pig?" and it will be hella embarrassing for you.
I never understood. If you not planning on masterbating what's the point of watching porn. Do people like having boners they can't do anything with.

Model it after my hammy post history.
I know, it's disgusting. It's everyone else's fault that they are fat but theirs, right? And welcome! I just discovered this subreddit a few days ago and it's like my new home!
Hams that claim mental illness as their excuse for being hams definitely make me the angriest. I'm fucled in the head and I binge eat and I'm still thin, it isn't an excuse.
Fatty tries to ruin another great post.

Damn straight you young whippersnapper! I might have already ordered, but I can still look at the menu. And don't forget my senior discount.
Extreme vanity sizing.
I am content with my body, but I know it could use a little work. I am a bit too sedentary and need to get some muscle tone.

Then you say yes. :smiling_face_with_horns:
In the world where people are only either obese or dangerously underweight.
But why bother at that point? There is nothing you can do to stop it looking vile. And the measurements it gave make it more or less cylindrical. If all it's roles have the same circumference, how would you even know where it waist is?

Oh my god I have those pajamas..
Woo-hoo!
Yeah. There were probably more calories and crap in her salad than I have as an intake for a day. Insane.
If fph has taught me anything, it's that fatness is a physical illness and mental illness. Those butterballs really think they're curvy and have the perfect body and anything less is anorexia. It's mindblowing.
:( That truly isn't fair. Even type one diabetes is nothing compared to cancer.
I don't understand sometimes... Like... How can you be a girl today and a boy tomorrow and then get mad at someone for calling you the wrong word on a certain day...? Like if you're a girl dressed as a boy, you can't get mad at me for calling you a girl. You have a vagina for gods sake. You're a girl. You're welcome to act like a boy, dress like a boy, and do boy things, but you still have a vagina and can't get mad at me for calling you a girl.
&gt; thats something I havent seen in a long timeURL
The most liked comment on this video brought a tear to my eye (aside the homophobic slur of course.) "Makes me sick that a portion of my paycheck goes to gargantuan fat faggots like this. When someone gets that massive, they should be put down, not treated. It's too late at that point."
It's all BS of course, the cuddliness of a person has very little do with their bodies. I've had very skinny girls who are nice to cuddle and ones who are awful. Think it's more to do with going limp the right way than anything.Only benefit is you can actually get your arms around fit/slim girls.

In your dreams, dude. I don't drink sugar water. But enjoy that Mexican Coke that you think it's worth knowing where to buy! Next time, try to come up with a retort that wasn't already anticipated in the comment you're replying to.&gt; (As an obligatory disclaimer, sugars should be consumed in moderation. Putting HFCS in everything is not good. But putting cane sugar in everything would be no better. And Mexican Coke is no healthier than US Coke.)
Got the right show though
I think they just want people to tell them they look good the way they are so they can justify not making progress. Post a pic like that and there's an onslaught of "you're beautiful they way you are" and "you don't need to lose weight to be beautiful".

Lol.
The poor little girl recoiled from the tremors.
Cat's look says "oh boy. Another day of hearing Owner make that little *whistling* sound trying to breathe while sitting on couch."
Honestly though, just "not eating" was the tactic I took to lose weight. It's not like I starve myself though; I still consume like 1500-2000 calories a day, it's just that I grew really accustomed to massive meals, and I found it easier to still eat massive meals but only once a day rather than change the whole way I approach food and eat multiple smaller meals. To an outsider, it may certainly seem like I don't eat, but that's just because I consume like 75% of my daily calories in one sitting.
Oh god not the dreaded "let me tell you something", that, or if you do something they told you not to do, or said would go bad, and it of course goes bad, if they find out you are ruined, they will not let it go that they told you not to.
Aw, see now, that's what a cute tummy looks like! Hey, guys! After you're done vomiting, check this out!!!
It's really disgusting that she let herself become so huge. I have to say though that if I were about to die with no hope of living, I'd probably grant myself any quick dopamine rush I could.

Well what the fuck do they want, if the pizza shop were to cut the guy off and refuse to serve him, they would bitch about that too. Goddamn.
I used to like Walmart when it had variety, now it's just big aisles of a few items they deemed most popular. Then the ones here take 20+ minutes to check out. Plus the noxious smell of Subway or McDonald's while you're trying to pick out produce..no thanks.
Always irked me when they wrote bleed instead of bled.

When I went to France, all the food I tried was *incredibly* rich, but it was served in small portions. I gained a couple pounds because I was 17 and allowed to drink legally which meant I polished off half a bottle of wine every day. My friend gained 15-20 lb in two weeks because she ate the same food until she was full. Then she complained how I never gained weight (I was chubby at the time) and how it was so unfair that she could never eat any food that she enjoyed. Wut.
Good ol' Canada, always ahead of the curve.

Yeah its my fault you are fat hooray fatlogic cunts
I seriously hate that fat chicks think they can curl their hair, put on red lipstick and be "pin-up" girls. Pin-up girls are supposed to be attractive. You would never see people putting up pictures of fat chicks on their walls back in the 40s and 50s. They have distorted views of what was deemed attractive back then. I would like to change the name of fat chick pin-up models to "forklift-up" girls.

wait, what? I'm genuinely confused. Why would anyone read my my comment and think I was a fatty or a fatty sympathizer? I was replying to mysonisdead's comment and thought it was funny?Why would me laughing at and approving of a comment comparing ham "vagina" to black holes make people think I was a fatty or a fatty sympathizer? Apparently a lot did because I got 56 down votes, I don't see the connection

...Have you seen a teenager before?
Yup. Over the past few years I've been struck by health issues, including Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, where I have very low stamina and no energy ever. Some days I am too weak to stand, and can walk very little. I have to rest as much as possible. I did gymnastics for over 10 years and was always active prior to this.Did I balloon up to mass proportions with this pretty much sedentary lifestyle? Nope. I kept eating mostly healthy and sufficient but not excess calories. I haven't gained weight. I actually lost a couple pounds which was most likely muscle from the lack of exercise. 5'7 and currently 149 lbs. Real proof right here fatties!
-Step dad and all his extended family are hamplanets except our alcoholic aunt (One aunt cries about back and knee problems, blames her fatness on cancer and spinal injury even though those came AFTER)-Cousin and wife are planet status and are now raising a child (both unemployed and stay at home all day - wife whines on FB how difficult it is being a single stay at home mom and I rage because my mom worked 3 jobs to support us and own a home while I was younger)-Skinny stepsister now gained many lbs and refuses to work more than part time so she can see her furry BF-Obese stepsister - always trying to "diet" - went to doctors and BP was 180/100 - MD gave her a diuretic to take and suddenly shes 30 lbs lighter (visibly so) and tells everyone on FB she worked SO HARD to lose the weight - then takes diet pills and comes to me concerned about heart palpitations she's been having. Denies diet pills. Orange streaks in mom's toilet tell me otherwise. (Mom pointed these out.) She's easily 240+ lbs. Posts blueberries and strawberries on FB as a "lunch" but doesn't mention the cake she has after. Has hot dogs as fingers. She disgusts me. Oh and once she stole a sweater of mine from a store we both shopped at and she got the same one too (favorite one, wrote my name in it because I know her). I leave to go back to college that week and I KNOW i left it sitting on chair in kitchen. Stepdad confronts her, she says "ITS A MEDIUM. IT WOULDN'T FIT HER ANYWAYS." At this time she was like 50 more lbs than I was and wasn't exactly planet status yet. I was so mad I called her a fatass bitch and told her to keep the damn thing since she stretched it out by now. She was crying and my stepdad STILL thought it was HERS. I get a call when I get back to campus and its my mom saying she sorry and my name really was written in the tag. Bitch ALWAYS stole my clothes. -My own dad has a fatty liver now and still doesn't even make an attempt to exercise. Dating an obese woman who has two kids. THEIR dad is horrible fat and always in the hospital because he doesn't take care of himself. NO ESCAPE. I've tried talking to my mom about maybe eating healthier but she cries that there is no money for healthy food and they can get by on just a box of hamburger helper so why make more. Step dad works in a factory and does a lot of lifting but he's been doing it for YEARS and they count it as exercise. I was fat as a child (My mom just bought me root beer to drink all day and wouldn't let my play outside because it was "dangerous". Also grandparents made me pizza like EVERY DAY.) I lost a lot of weight in HS and a little beyond and step dad kept telling me I looked like a skeleton and needed to eat more and always tried to give me 2nd and 3rd servings of everything. Made me feel like shit for that. I love my family a lot but they refuse to learn to eat healthier. My step dad visibly cringes when I mention green vegetables and my mom follows him now. When there is a holiday they make TONS of food - like, 4th of July there's burgers ribs, chicken, meatpockets, sausage, hot dogs, and veggie free salads galore. All for like 15 people. Everyone just stuffs their faces. My mother always defends my stepdad by saying things like " he works hard all week let him enjoy himself" - yeah well how enjoyable is it to depend upon medication for cholesterol and blood pressure every day. I would like for my parents to live to see a grandchild but at this rate they won't and I sure as hell am not gonna rush that.  (Sorry I have a lot of aggression there........)
Whales commonest have between 6-11 inch layer of blubber these beasts are literally fatter than whales
Yeah, if the person doesn't have any skin.
Ok, to be fair, BMI is just a basic calculation of your weight in relation to your height. Any body builder is going to be "obese" according to BMI. For example, I'm currently around 180lbs and 6 feet tall, but I lift weights and have some muscle. The last time I weighed 180 was when I was losing weight from maxing out at 210, and had basically no muscle. I'm in better shape now than I was then, but my bmi would be exactly the same at both points. This guy is an idiot for trying to say his BMI is that low, but he could be in great shape, just saying.But it is the internet so I doubt it.
This is more about the pathetic mindset of women than it is about fat people. Women online are the Fox News of the dating world.
"nutella challenge", ie "I want an excuse to pig out and feel like it's an achievement"
Nice to see your argument failed so hard you've just resorted to calling me a big meany. You're pretty pathetic man.
Ha! That's *exactly* my height and weight :)
My animals follow eachother around with their noses shoved so far in eachother's rectums that I'm starting to wonder if they might be proctologists and even they won't steal from my plate.
Geez, these are the people that give vegans a bad name. Productions like this don't change minds, it just makes people more entrenched in their beliefs.
W-what even...
Any urges that I might have are the furthest thing from uncontrollable. Keep in mind that though it's a common stereotype there is no actual evidence for the idea of pedophiles having higher libidos than anyone else. When you're left alone with an adult women, do you suddenly get the insatiable urge to have sex with her? I'm no hornier than your average person.
You don't need to be obsessed with dieting or working out to be thin, you fat stupid fucking cunts. You can be shredded and eat mcdonalds. It's all about caloric expenditure vs caloric intake. And we're not mad about seeing "Happy" fats. Whoever wrote that article is a fucking retard.
Wow, you're right. Damn.
My first thought was that she's over 21 and can buy them booze. :p
Can confirm. In highschool I got the cold/sniffles almost everyday. Started Lifting/exercising in college and those ailments seem to magically dispear. Similar thing happened to my little brother
"I have to walk inside to complain. I have a chronic injury that makes this difficult".Bullshit. Yeah, I'd have difficulty walking too if I had to carry over a hundred excess pounds with my body as well. Injury my ass, fatty is just complaining.
I wasn't brigading I just voiced my opinion on a certain reply and left it at that
If only Vlad the Impaler were here to teach these fatties how to pole-dance properly.
The kid on the bottom left looks disgusted. I mean, I would be.
"OMG you're so lucky you can just stay skinny. It doesn't matter what I do, I just can't lose weight."
Extremely. I would get a refund for being subjected to such a severe inconvenience.
It looks more like lymphoedema - to be specific.
"Are ya hungry?"
I can never get passed how much these people must eat in one day. Fat like this doesn't sustain itself. If she just cut down to 2000 calories/day she'd probably drop 150 pounds in a few months.EDIT: Not that it'd matter too much at this point. Her skin and body are irreparably ruined without extensive surgery...and even then.
You can if it won't lead to vote brigading. I've seen a mod confirm this
I won't post the title, but it involves the words: "Fat Justice, Food Justice, Sizeism". Also this is a throwaway cause FB friends know my reddit name, but not my shitlording.
OP, this hambeast is disgusting on the outside and cannot hide it with clothing. You and your faggot friend can choose to at least dress differently and not let the world know what autists you are.
Love it. Who even uses 'virgin' as an insult over the age of 14?
Yeah. About half way through the shows, he addressed his weight gain, talked about it and talked about his diet. He talks about portion control a lot. Yes you will see cakes and fatty foods, but you will see lots of healthy stuff, how to shop for foods, and science behind food and cooking.
Bitch even has a Piglet phone case...
It's probably licensed character fabric. Places like Joann's and Walmart and such have it.
You know, you're not *literally* a cracker just because you smoke a lot of crack.
Plus the fact that over a certain age, people are absolutely not willing to change their ways or their way of thinking. So obviously it didn't work on the old farts!
But...but...muh good personality!!1!
Fat people are always going on about how thin women "look like boys", or built women look like men. Then there was the lardass who commented on a post about some guy's bodybuilding progress with "some of us were born men" because apparently a real man is incapable of jogging a mile. The irony is half the time an obeast's sex is completely ambiguous. Their jealousy is always so fucking transparent.
Well, fuck you too!
Okay, banned. I can ban you faster than you can create new accounts. Have a nice life.
&gt; I think a better idea would just to make flair mandatory after a certain amount of time.Impossible. We have 68k subscribers right now, and hundreds more every day.&gt;I think it would be interesting to have a FPH lounge of some sort that only verified people can have access to. Perhaps it could be to discuss anything instead of just hate.We have an IRC.
You really can't be thin or fit and proud of your body without getting flack. I love breaking "I'm so fat/ugly!" circle jerks. If you say "Oh, I'm sorry you feel like that" or "I feel great! You should come to the gym with me" man people lose it.
It's annoying. I religiously upvote amd downvote every song in order to avoid pop songs during a cardio sesh. Stupid Pandora thinks because I happen to like *one* Ke$ha song that I must like all the pop songs.
Overconsumption of sugar and processed crap breaks that mechanism within the hams.
I don't have a main I just lurk, I literally haven't had a reason to do otherwise until your shit post. You're clearly projecting but enjoy your heart attack friend.
Anything to get out of the barracks.
...Uhm hasn't anyone else noticed that the guy isn't much slimmer/thinner than her? I mean you can clearly see he would fall in the 'overweight' category for sure though....
let it fall. so the rest of us can watch and learn.
Genetic BS. From what I've seen, siblings who grew up in an environment with heavy parents just pick up fat logic and habits from them. They grow up and just keep the fat habits and stay fat. Then they think it's the genetics. As a petite Asian American girl with slim parents, it's astonishing to meet my heavy friends' heavy family. There are reasons why they're all heavy. It's like they just don't know any better. The little habits really do count.
In this context I took "be their world" to mean the only thing in their world. If you mean "be their world" to mean the most important thing then yes I completely agree.
Also known as thunder thighs.

He has the potential to be so fucking hot. I hope he does something about the skin. But if he gets surgery or something and they take off the extra skin on his chest... will he not have nipples?
I have the surge which is the more expensive one. It has gps to track my runs, tracks my heart rate and helps me log the time I do other exercises so I can see progress. I also like the calorie counter on it. Plus it kind of pushes me to work out more so I can reach my goals every day. Over all the app on the phone is pretty good so that is why I chose the Fitbit over other workout bands. I should say I use to have just the step counter and I didn't feel that was as effective the more I worked out.
Her skin is just awful.
What's nauseating is that this happens about half a million times a year in this country alone.
No way he live to see 50.

Seriously, where is CPS in these situations? They'd be all over a family whose child was seriously skinny.
They would just lie. Guys lie about their height, and every fatso would lie about their weight. Even with full body shots people lie by posting old pics.

The holiest of fucks.
Veganism is really easy to do improperly. Plenty of terrible food is vegan. A vegan can go home and eat french fries, chocolate, chips, cookies, cake, and have a beer or soda with it. A lot of "fad vegans" the sort that hopped on the trendy bandwagon have some misconception that veganism itself means weight loss, which is not the case. Just like with any other diet, it requires balance and calorie watching. I'm also going to assume (this is just me, not any sort of research) that a lot of people who call themselves vegans, aren't really. They'll be an at-home vegan but eat whatever they want on the weekends or when they go out to a restaurant.
That. But also treating myself with an ice cream or something and watching bigger people look on in envy as I eat guilt-free and they hate that they can't say I might be skinny, but at least they don't starve themselves like I do.
The expression says, "What is this rectangular black thing? Can I eat it?"
Hams in the Army probably the most fucking annoying things about the entire organization.You LITERALLY get paid(/forced) to work out and food is provided for you.
In my link, it's five foot eight. other sources I find on Google seen to put American and canadian height around the five eight five nine area. I'm from Sask...the height on average there is definitely taller than the national averages, I notice it every time I leave or come back. Five foot four women are an oddity there instead of every time I turn around.
During lymphatic cancer, organ failure and for years after organ transplantation, some people retain very large amounts of fluid that accumulates in soft tissue like the face. It is at least possible that something else other than obesity contributed to her health issues. I had a normal-weight female friend that had disproportionate "chubby cheeks" after receiving a kidney transplant due to her kidney issues, strong steroids and other medications to prevent auto-immune rejection.
I could watch this for hours.
the fatties already consumed all the hate and left me with none.i'd hate them for it but they ate it, so
Imagine being a fat Asian, your field of vision would be basically nil.
At least someone can.It looks like it's quite a climb.
Dunno, now that I relook at it I think I could do it easily. I'm sure I've eaten more at Old Country Buffet when challenging cousins to see how much we could eat.
Euugh... I visited some friends in california, we went to a mall and all of them bought a huge cinnamon roll with pecans and had an extra large iced coffee... I nearly puked.Sadly yes, my friends have become planets themselves...
I have no sympathy for fat people, I just wish there were less of them. Especially less of them at the gym. They look like they're in pain, they're mostly getting the stink eye from everyone, just go home.People have this reflex that to lose weight they need to exercise. They embarrass themselves a few times and give up. Just decide to lose weight, stay home and eat less. Or do something else that gets you out of the house. Forget about exercise, that's for when you're normal again.
&gt; the same as an average size american female*sigh*

One of the most beautiful things that I saw when I went to Europe for the first time was a couple walking on the street in France. There was a decent looking, well dressed man walking with his model of a wife. She couldn't have been more than 120lbs, and was so toned and slender...the baby she was pushing in the stroller was 4 weeks old. Until then I had always thought being fat and gross looking was an inevitable part of birth. I now have hope for the future.
I can get behind that. One group of the LGBT that is a bunch of shitlords is traps. Just saying.. so these education documentaries?
This is sooooo true. My dad is a slim dude, always has been. However, that's only due to his active life, because his diet is crap. Way too much processed food, fat and cholesterol. In December, he had a quadruple bypass because of the plaque that built up over the years. He had already had 2 stints in the years prior. A shitty diet will most definitely catch up to your BF sooner or later. Granted, he's nowhere near my father's age, but that's beside the point.

The only surprise is that they didn't finish it. They didn't get where they are by knowing when not to eat things.
That's a female specimen - the Bobby Hill hairdo is a bit of a curve ball though.
New idea: start a clothing line for fat eatbeasts with *intentional* designs that do this. Of course, the tags will say **lose weight, fatty** underneath all of the wash and care instructions, though.
&gt;Whenever the women around me talk about how great so-and-so looks now that she’s joined that pricey gym or gone under the knife (even if so-and-so is still sort of a bitch), I remember purging and popping pills and eating three well-balanced meals a day; binging and starving and reading “Anna Karenina” on a StairMaster. But none of it left me happier or healthier. Just hungry.YES. BECAUSE THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO OBESITY IS EATING DISORDERS. THIS IS LAW.
Awesome very inspiring makes me stop whining about needing to lose 20lbs

You can't get a woman because you scare them. Reread what you wrote as though I wrote it. That is what you are projecting to them when you try to talk to them or get a date. That is going to scare them away. You need to learn to have fun, relax, and not take things so seriously. Those are things women find attractive.

Hard pill to swallow?!Dude every keto recipe I have made was fucking delicious.
Yes, sadly. The only way to cure yourself now is to ask some feminists. I don't know they exact ritual, but it's something about swearing you'll kill all men. I'd sign up, but I'm not vaccinated so I don't see the point :/
Judge them all you want, but making fun of people for putting in effort at anything in life, not just fitness, makes you a sad bitter insecure piece of shit.
You are the densest person I've encountered in a long time. Show me ANY credible scientific evidence that sexuality can be changed. Again, ALL OF THE EVIDENCE suggests that any attempt to change from homosexual to heterosexual will most likely be unsuccessful and cause psychological damage. From a scientific standpoint, sexuality *can not* be changed. Show me any research supporting the claim you've just made that hasn't been redacted.Edit: in case you choose to not read the data again, these studies show that about 90% of people who attempt to change their sexuality fail to do soURLURL

That's not entirely accurate. When cremating a bigger body, you have to compensate for their size, that's true. But you can get this black smoke from burning any size body if you have an incompetent operator.
Charging into battle on the scooty puff made me laugh. I'm sorry that you had to go through that though. I do volunteer work at a VA hospital, albeit one of the better ones, but I see some similar things. All the walkways/wards are named things like "Heroes Corner" or "Freedom Path". I also see a few angry, overweight nurses who are rude to everyone. There's only one vet I encounter regularly there on a scooty puff and he's kind of a pree-vert so I have my eye on him. And yes his scooty puff is all decked out with American flags. I'm sorry you have to put up with bullshit every time you go, you deserve better.

Vet tech here. I was working in the back one day and the doc calls for some help. This amorphous blob of a dog at his feet. This dog was a barrel with legs that could barely support its own weight. We got it on the scale and it weighed it at 110 pounds. A female boxer is normally 35-45 pounds, very lean dogs, if rolled down a hill this one wouldnt stop. The doc retold the conversation with the fat owner. Owner: "ya i am not sure what to feed my dog" Doc: "less! What do you feed the dog?"Owner: "well she gets a double cheese burger sometimes two everyday along with her other food"A double cheese burger... everyday...
Crazy, crazy crazy world. Just plain nuts. However, it also shows you how powerful a well placed campaign can be. They are going to convince young ladies that being 200+ pounds is "healthier" than being normal weight and that is just plain dangerous. Makes me wonder is this isn't a misogynist attack on women. Someone, somewhere is having a laugh.

Sadly, a fatty out there some where is probably triggered by skinny girls. It sets off their impulse to shove more food in to their gaping maw to make up for what I'm not eating :/ But thank you kindly :)
I'm amazed people can eat so much. I track my calories religiously and exercise everyday and the only way I can get to even 1500 is if I drink a lot of beer.Not hating on people who eat a lot to bulk, of course...

Hahaha. That reminds me of my old housemate. Whenever we forced her to clean her mess she would just stare at it for 15 minutes before bursting into tears about how cleaning was stressful for her. She would tell us that we had to do it because she would have an anxiety attack otherwise. My other housemates would buckle, but they were finally fed up at near the end of our lease. On the final day, one housemate told her that she didn't have any other options and she was going to have to clean her trash or pay for whatever cleaning fines we were charged. Ham went from crying like a baby to sudden rage. "SHUT UP! YOU CAN'T *MAKE* ME CLEAN IT!! YOU'RE NOT MY FUCKING FRIEND!" It's actually kind of fascinating to watch a 24 year old women instantly regress to being a toddler.

I'm jealous as all fuck. I just looked up the Apple Watch, the Samsung Gear, and the Fitbit HR and they're all too fucking large for me to wear. (125 mm / 5" wrist circumference) I even emailed Fitbit to ask if it'll still read a heartrate if it's too loose, since their smallest wrist band starts at 5.5". I'm kinda pissed, I have been saving up for a Fitbit HR for awhile but I had no idea until today that it might be too large. When I was searching to see if other people had a similar problem, it was just an endless list of people complaining that these watches/gear/fitbits are too small for them, including priceless comments like this:&gt; I'm to the very last hole on my band to fit comfortably.... **My wrist is mostly bone at 7 5/8inch. Any fat I have is mostly on my torso 260lbs 6'2"**That's a BMI of 33.4 btw. But sure, his wrist is mostly bone. For fuck's sake. He is almost certainly lying about his wrist being "bone".

My dad developed type 2 diabetes a long time ago, and like a retard he mostly ignored it. As time progressed and he had to take stronger and stronger pills to loosely manage his diabetes, he began to feel worse on a daily basis (Blood sugar levels were spiking like crazy, constant migraines and always feeling tired). This past Christmas I went full-shitlord on him, our last conversation before I left was "You're going to die earlier than you should." IT WORKED!!! He's lost a ton of weight, his blood sugar levels are consistent and much closer to a healthy persons, his energy level is steadier, and he's even switched back to a lower dose of his meds which didn't make him feel worse. I'm sure some FA would say this had nothing to do with his weight loss, fuck them.

You'd have to actually physically starve for this, which takes weeks. Your body doesn't go into starvation mode from skipping a meal, like all these hogs seem to think.
Sugar free jello is super low calorie and good for when you know for a fact you are about to give in to a binge. I used to swear by it before I went vegan. Also if you cant eat the actual fruit, you can always blend it. Soy milk and berries makes a great and very healthy smoothie.
This is why fat acceptance, even if you wanted to maybe even pretend to see it as something positive, is a joke. It's a bunch of people wanting THEIR fat to be accepted by normal people so that they don't have to breed with people like then. They basically want to skip a hundred social tiers without doing any work.
Well BMI is negatively correlated with IQ, so most fatties probably do suck at maths.
Still with a bmi over 100
Those poor seams on the yoga pants... :(
That dude was as much of a hamplanet as her, until she sucked him dry. Good on ya, mate!
I'm pretty sure I recognise her. Shes very active on different sites for feeders/feedees. That BIIIIGG belly is what happens to them when they intentionally gain hundreds of fucking pounds.
Good on him for sticking to his guns. Don't back down from social pressure to say its ok to be overweight.
My wife has always been petite, even when she tried eating more. She often felt bad when people told her she "should eat more". Her doctor told her that it was good that she didn't put on as much weight as the other moms, you only need a couple extra 100 kcal during most of the pregnancy. That's like an extra fruit per day.The whole "eat for two" thing doesn't mean you should double your portions. The doctor felt bad having to tell pregnant women to not put on so much weight.
Jon Party from Big Brother Canada season 2. Poor guy.
The toenails! Oh my god, that's so disgusting.
I mean this for real I have no idea. I'm not a redditor. (do you consider yourself a redditor?) Did I violate some rule?
Yes yes i know. Im working on it. Im willing to go to 120 presently. My next weigh in is in 2 weeks and ive been eating 2 full meals a day (i used to only have liquids). Im hoping to be at 116 by then possibly 117.
What do these hams think people are gonna assume from a zoomed in picture? If every pic of you on okcupid is just your face, I'm already assuming the worst. Then again, if it didn't work, they wouldn't keep doing it. Some suckers out there must be taking these girls out to a 1 time only lunch or something.
Here's a little science about weightlifting. When you lift weights it breaks down your muscle tissue. This tissue is then rebuilt stronger over roughly the next 48 hours. During this time your resting metabolism is increased by the process of muscle repair. Eating right is the most important thing in weight loss, but that doesn't mean cardio and lifting does not help.
Some of them are so deluded that they feel they can be fat and post in a subreddit that specifically says "No being fat" in the rules. Shitnobility, we have *yet another case* of an entitled ham. You see this? It means "Not welcome". ^banned
Salad: Spinach, iceberg lettuce (I know. I know.), grilled chicken, peanuts for crunch and yum, throw in some fucking avocado when I'm feeling adventurous, olive oil and vinegar. GGWP.
Poor kid. I worked at a fast food place for a while and it made me feel sick to have to serve huge, calorie-laden meals to little kids whose parents were feeding them so much they had stretch marks at only 8 years old. There was one little girl I would see every single day.
Let the kid know that, in the long run, she's the winner.When she becomes a teenager, and then an adult, she'll feel so much better because she's not a fatass, while those fats will have gotten even fatter. With all the obesity in society today, she's a member of the elite few. She'll have greater choice of dating partners, jobs, and a generally happier and healthier lifestyle.
Well, when they literally take up the entire field of view, I would say they don't even try to be noticed either. Fat lazy fucks.
I feel like this was directed at the one non-fatty in a group by a fatty serving cake who feel the need to enforce group cake eating. That "go on, you're thin, you can eat some cake" shit is so annoying.

Mabye it's because it's a bitch to pay for your insurance when the lard seeps into your heart.

So "bad angle" = "Shows my fatty fat fat fatness"

I don't think they count anything that isn't sitting down to a meal at a table. Like they think grazing on candy and doughnuts throughout the day doesn't count as calories, it's just to keep their sugars up.
And they're even taking pictures of it. But it's ok, they walked from the back of the parking lot so they earned it! /s

Idk. I really don't you feel as if you've seen it all after spending a while here but then something like this pops up
Didn't you read the list of her daily diet? She's anheroing.
I looked at the clock...yes! Lunch time. Go on reddit.Boom goes my breakfast.Anyone got eye bleach? Please?
You are the winner. It's magical really. By the presence of your body alone, you were able to change the behavior of that woman. She was so upset at how much better looking you are, she had to verbally abuse you to make herself feel better. That's awesome. Quite an achievement. Imagine the turmoil you caused in her head, as she struggled to think of a way to dismiss your obvious superiority. Just awesome. This stuff never happens to me. I just always get old fat black women grabbing my arms and telling me how nice they are.
Also, white. So apparently as a brown person I'm not allowed to complain about it.

Gains of adipose are no gains at all.
Baseball isn't really a sport.
Well that escalated quickly
Before reading your comment, I had the same thought and went looking for a gif of it. On the one hand, shocking fatties is amusing for everyone. On the other hand, think of the energy crisis we'd be thrown in to.[Bart and the cupcake](URL
Can't really play the swipe-right game anymore now that they have introduced swipe limits. I used to employ that method because it's way faster to just filter through the matches, but now I get a message saying I have reached my limits and have to wait 24 hours to see any more profiles.
Exactly, and when you see the blog hashtag posts, its always 8 women to 1 guy, and the guy always is just sad and pathetic. The fat lifestyle is really being pushed on women and thats where we gotta level the hate.
I honestly didn't see that this had already been posted by someone else. I grabbed some Chick-fil-A to carb up after my workout and saw this on the bag. Sorry for the repost.
They call it fabulous, but I believe tlc knows what they are doing. Its shitlords running that show. You can tell bc they always play that hilarious whomp whomp music when they get their swimsuits on or when they blubber to the camera.
It really isn't. It really, really isn't. Physics, Medicine, Mathematics, Engineering are real disciplines. Humanities are also important - History, Law, Economics, etc. But gender studies? As a discipline and degree in its own right, alongside the others? Are you telling me that gender studies should be a discipline like Chemistry or Geography? What's next, furniture studies? Color studies? Anything you want studies?
There is/was one I think..look in the sidebar
This actually hits me in the feels, I'm an A cup and its not something i can change with exercise.. Whereas these fucking fat asses can change their weight.
Guy must be paralyzed from the waist down and trying to regain feeling... not worth it dude
How can a face be beautiful if it has 25 extra pounds on it? No such thing as a 300lb woman with a pretty face. GTFO sympathizer.
Alcohol is a poison. You can also vape weed or take it an edible or use concentrates for 0 smoke inhalation.
This perfectly illustrates one of the issues with fatties. They ruin entire websites for everyone else to use, and it's pissing people off.
They wouldn't be fat because CARDIO LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER, or they can't catch criminals and shit. Duh. They look like comicon IRL tho...
Surely, by now you know there are 365 days in a standard year. Or do you still need me to dumb it down for you, silly rabbit?
Looking at this person's history, it's a lurking ham. They only have one comment post and it's on a submission here about two weeks ago.
If I was down 30 minutes, I would be running a 5k in about three to five minutes. Amazing stuff, guys.
Sorry never noticed that!
online dating seems difficult for those reasons and many more. I live in a large, healthy city. fat people are pretty rare here, so the dating pool is vast and wide, and i feel like everyone wants to keep their options open. It's hard to find (or know when you're in) a relationship, because everyone plays it so cool.
Probably just butt-hurt fatties who can't classify anything related to their own fatness.
No shit. Where are all the posts of pics of every single normal sized person crossing the finish line? Why should this person be praised any more than each and every single one of them? It has taken all of them more work to stay fit than it has her to do this one thing. Fuck her and fuck all fat people that think they deserve extra special praise for doing what all the rest of us consider commonplace.
I prefer to think that fit women are fundamentally sadists and enjoy tormenting their prey -- taking control, if you will -- and watching them beg for mercy....of course, porn may have led me astray. :$Naaahhh. No way. Can't be.
You know, I've always liked to make people laugh. But it's always best when it's a beautiful woman.
But you just did.

And white vinegar. Barf. Well it actually looks like barf. Ugh.
How is she going to take that off? ...not by losing weight I guess.
Yeah. That's exactly what happens.
I showed this to my wife and it scared her. Before this she didn't believe monsters existed.
I'm glad justice was served in your instance.
She looks like she has Down syndrome there's so much fat fucking up her face
Sorry, meant /r/4chan. Then again, 4chan has devolved, too. Just look at that fat dancing fuck who was ashamed after someone took his picture and 4chan came to his "rescue".
I can just hear the tortured shriek of that swingset. Fuck, that's going to keep me up for hours.
Exactly this lol.It is even funnier when they make up thyroid excuses and then you see them eating ice cream. I am like "So where's your thyroid problem"?And I even have skinny friends with real thyroid problems, guess what? They take a fucking pill every day because its 2015 and we have a cure for almost everything.

Thank you sir. I guess we bike a lot and there is still somewhat of a social stigma towards fat people. But a lot of young ones, particularly young women, identifying as 'feminists', confuse individual choice with equal rights. A lot are fat, they're ALL disgusting pieces of shit, getting fatter slurping on their venti quad-shot beetus drizzle drinks. It needs to stop. We have enough real problems as it is, we don't need this on top of it.
ha I thought the same thing!!!
Really looking forward to seeing you banned, fatty. :) Shitlords, report the fatty!

Whaaaaaaat is going on here.....
&gt; It's a major bummer because she looks like she would be a 10 if she wasn't fat.Duh, any hamplanet will look better losing 200lb. Take this shit somewhere else.
And I agree with you!
Had a waiver when I was in the Army (got shit all the time because I was white) But it was just same length for neck and face, infact I would think shaving the face and keeping the neck hair could be considered styling of your beard. (not a good look but still). All your profile did was say whatever length and all hair had to be kept at that length, mine was 1/8th an inch.
I was trying to hold the shirt out to get it all in the photo kinda looking down. Terrible photo. Terrible excuse.
Seen this so many times but it's so so so perfect :)

Same here. I was wondering how a title like that would get past the mods, but then I took a close look at the thumbnail and had to laugh.
Are we playing Guess the Gender again?
Well this (Hate on Women) happens amongst MANY subreddits. Why dont you go fight their cause, and leave a stated 'Hate' group like the KKK alone.We're not changing our minds, they've been changed in the 30 years I've seen niggers on wellfare while my 85 year old grandmother works.We;re not 'removing' the visual records we have of coons posing their young children to become thugs themselves....I cannot unsee that kind of child abuse.We're not getting over the audacious costs involved in 'helping' a 5 time felon junglemonkey spending welfare on drugs.
This shit gets to anyone, I don't want kids, I plan to be childfree for life. It pisses me off because these type of kids don't have a damn chance in the world to break free from this abuse cycle and they themselves would later abuse their own blood. I really wish there were more regulation on having kids than just simply popping one out. Perhaps, a mandatory psychological screening on having a kid. For fuck sakes we shouldn't be breeding like animals, we are fucking human beings we need to put more care in what type of people we allow to take care of our citizens. rant/
I think spring is coming. Clear and sunny skies all day today, so far at least. It's warm as well. I'm gonna need to find better gear than jeans and a hoodie for jogging now or I'm gonna sweat like a Hambeast. But foot is still fucked and I can't run T_T

I have seen a lot of similar pics on Instagram and FB, I know it's referred to as "waist training" however I have no idea what that actually means, or how/if/why it works.
All publicity is good publicity for us. This sub is just yet another symptom of their gluttony.
dat science
You could try an alt account. Or just see what fun they post :3
Yeah! Good, you are strong. Don't let the fatties poison your life! Don't let them win!
Hm, I think there's a sub for this...r/NoFatKids? Might help you out.
&gt;I feel like the second part is untrue. Eh some guys do it just because they get off to degrading insecure cam girls.

This is why I demand proof every time... from men at least. If it's on my face then I know it happened. *thumbs up*
She got dumber. I can see it in her face.
I like how innocent and honest this statement is. I also like how fat girls will take this as a personal attack and probably be *triggered* by it since everything in life revolves around them.
&gt;there's a reason a lot of fat people call themselves chubby but get insulted when called fat.Yeah. Same reasons as why whales get insulted when we call them obese. That reason is that they cannot accept reality.
There definitely is more chance of meeting a fatty than there is of meeting a lardbeast. I guess I'm just mean enough that I would have no problem turning around and walking out if my date turned out to be fat, though. I could be driving home already by the time they even got out the door to chase me.
Damn, I bet she couldn't cross or close her gross legs to save her life. Eww
This sub has ruined me. I was 100 % convinced that this post was going to be someone stating that they have a BMI of 39 and classified as obese and going on a rant about only being chubby.Although I suppose that is what is happening as it calls itself a small fat... And then confuses me by saying that it thinks &gt;that's pretty fat tbhSo, do they agree with us that small fats are fat? But disagree on what is considered "small fat"? In reality a BMI of 39 makes you a butter beast... a BMI of ~25-28 makes you a small fat.
In a perfect world, fat would mean in the range of 22.5-25 BMI and not swole. I can dream.
Boxxy?

This might be a fatty paradox. The fatter it is the farther away from it you will stay but the larger the text on the shirt.

Hambeasts like it because mermaids have no 'thigh gap', and they're just trying to go back to their natural habitat as a whale; although they're in denial about their natural form.

Is that a sweater or a dress? Because if it's a dress it's too short in the back and if it's a sweater she needs pants/leggings not pantyhose.
Okay, no worries and thanks for contributing!

Do you have a flat stomach? if not, you can't complain if he doesn't. If you do, someone mentioned stabbing him in the eye socket earlier, I like that one.
She's fat and couldn't hold her own weight.

tbf the strongest guys often look fat because to keep up that level of muscle they dont cut any weight and eat a shitload. a fat looking lifter is very different than a fat ass who thinks he lifts though
Not to point out sexism or anything else, but in the frontpage I think there are far more women than men. Or maybe is just me.

What, really? Maybe in the US, but I assure you, the rest of the world cares for their health. I've had annual blood work and complete physicals since I was 16. People that don't have health problems don't get blood work done? I guess, if you want to find your problem in the "its too late" stage.

ah chris chan. last I heard about him he pepper sprayed a gamestop employ because sonic's arms aren't blue anymore.
yah, pretty much. what sucks a major sack too is that she dropped this on me at like 4:00 today. we've been planning this, me and him, since like last fall. I told her she was invading that and she still had the fupa to tell me that I hadn't even been up there to see him once since HS and that somehow was why she was entitled to the accommodation. I've been trying to reach him all afternoon and I cant get him (I'm sure he'll be furious when he finds out). If he's cool with that he can keep his hams and I'm gonna stick to my mostly shitlord friends down here. (who all hate her BTW)
dogs face says "just my fucking luck. Why did she have to pick me?"
You're not gonna get banned for naming some fat broad that's apparently "internet famous".
On the map I'm seeing, the countries are ranked individually. But anyways, I see what you're saying now.
I wonder how long it's been since she slept on her back.
Me too.
absolutely disgusting. This sub is perfect for quenching any sweet cravings
I do know a guy who works his ass off on a farm, but he eats right too. He is pretty fucking jacked. He also hits the gym (I don't think as regularly due to work), so I don't see the need to hate on gym rats. Besides, a bigger muscle is a stronger muscle. Bodybuilders actually are pretty strong in general.
you forgot this "/s"
There's no way she is comfortable
Thank you brother, sometimes I forget others have been successful. Brodin wach over me.
I feel like "unrealistic" and "unattainable" are their new buzz words. News flash, fatties: your expectation that the world should conform to your blubberous shape is unrealistic. A resting heart rate for you that doesn't seem to belong to a hummingbird is unattainable. Being human shaped is literally the most realistic goal you could have as a (former) human.
Nah it'd be darker.Homegirl can't reach the middle of her back because of her 30 inch biceps.
In Finland, you can't just pile food in front of a cow or pig . It has to be top notch quality and therefore it costs a pretty penny to feed them..A whale can eat shit from the freezer aisle for fraction of the price...

I bet they use condoms, but the ham's vaginas are so greasy that it dissolved the latex, thus resulting in a pregnancy.
One of my ham coworkers that I dislike was bragging about this and asked if I was familiar with it. I told her no I don't need to lose weight. Lol I hope she gets anal leakage.
The thing is, you have to identify depression and do your fucking best to overcome it, you don't use it as an excuse to continue with your bad habits.Since an early age I had eating disorders (would barely eat, underweight) and depression due to early death of my main caretaker when I was 3yr old. I never got therapy until I was in my mid twenties, so during my childhood that shit snowballed to full lethargic depression, the depression is not an excuse for my fucking up, it's knowing what is wrong and know the source so I can be always aware wtf is going on so I can overcome it.I bet a good portion of fat people are depressed in some way, but self diagnosing it and using it as an excuse to continue to be fat is fucking stupid and insult to people that battle depression.
I hate this guy, but as someone who works in the medical field, FUCK that medication list.Pioglitazone is not a "water retention/diuretic," it is a thiazolidinedione used for the treatment diabetes that just so happens to have a side effect of water retention.Insulin in the US is not dosed in milligrams. It is dosed in units. Fuck fatties, but especially fuck whoever put together that medication list.
While I definitely agree that she holds the ultimate responsibility for what went into her mouth, he still played his own part. Having someone you love and want to fuck tell you that they like you better when you look a certain way can have a real influence on your behaviours. My boyfriend thinks my hair looks nicer when it's long, so I've been growing it out for awhile. Would I leave him if he said he wanted me to gain weight, absolutely, but then I have decent self-esteem and confidence in my ability to attract mates (well, male ones anyway, haven't tried attracting any women yet). If she was already on the heavy side when he pushed her to gain weight, she might have thought to herself that she'd never have a chance at another partner if he left.Again, not trying to absolve her of primary responsibility, but everyone can be manipulated, particularly by people whom they love and who claim to love them; to what extent depends on their mental state.
you don't keep buying new pants, that ALLOWS this whale to keep expanding. the whole point of your pants being tight is a sign of itself to STOP OVEREATING. she has a bf thats doing her a favor and trying to prevent health problems, but yea totally abusive. completely. yep.

&gt; Well, I gotta say, she nailed it.I know she's fat but damn you've got to give her credit. Like you said she *nailed it*.And honestly? That's more than a lot of thin/fit cosplayers manage. This chick did the hair and the costume and everything. Sooo not a half-assed attempt.

&gt; negging (which is a retarded concept in and of itself) It does have proper uses, mostly in part of something along the lines of "I know how you're trying to play the game, and I know how you'd like me to respond, but I don't want to play it that way". However, he's nowhere near that.(Also, the stereotypical misuse of the idea (and where it got its name) is also not applicable.)

ah i missed that! Thanks and happy cake day! (don't tell fatties they may come eat it)
It reminds me of a phenomenon you observe with black people: the idea of "good hair" or differentiating one another by shades of color.These fatties, despite being fat sacks of shit themselves, have it in them to dare presume superiority over the "bad fats". They are *so* warped.
The one thing that makes me retch more than anything else that fat people do/have is the guys whose bellies you can see under their shirt. Their shirt isn't quite long enough to cover their whole belly because it's pushing it out too far. It makes me gag. I can deal with so much shit from fat women because I'm so much more used to seeing it, whereas a fat man is more of an anomaly here. BTW, I know that's not the norm, so if you're wondering, most of the men in my city under age 40 are rig pigs(so, rednecks who make a lot of oil money) because you burn out of that lifestyle pretty young. So we have a lot of young and stupid but rich and attractive men in our city, and men who chase money are predominantly pretty fit here. As much as the FAs would like to say otherwise, that's a population sample that you can't ignore.

Enlightened or Resistance ?
When I see some amount of food that I know the fatty would gulp down in one setting (like a pizza), I play dumb and say things like, "OMG, that would feed me for a week." I also like eating semi-slow when eating out with a tubbs. The thing they order will be twice as much as what I do, they finish first, then I get halfway through mine and push it away saying I'm full. I love doing that.
Not necessarily! It could mean that _everyone_ is 25.
I call this a win-win
They're probably lizard people.Seriously we're getting way too specific trying to come up with a case that doesn't apply. There are always exceptions that fall outside the norm. The simple fact is that diabetes is a serious illness, particularly the kind you're born with, and the risks of complications goes way up if you have it and are also fat... Just like any other major illness, being overweight is a multiplier/
Well that's auto correct for ewe.
The average weight for a US female age 20+ is 166 lbs. Just sayin'.
I guess that fat Green Lantern got his ring from showing no fear of food.
Lazy ass elephant, just letting its kid walk all over it. Why don't you try being a parent?
Classic case of the guy realizing that the girl is out of his league and wants to end it before she realizes. But if course it always makes the girl feel unwanted when really the guy is just being a little butch.
Which Zoo is this Silverback Gorilla debuting in?
How long has it been? they are scars and scars fade over time.
It's interesting... Tan people used to be low because they were outdoor laborers and kings used to be fat to show wealth. Now the opposite is desirable and I love it.
You hit the nail on the head really. Have you ever been around someone dying of ALS? its similar.. becoming a prisoner in their own body. Then you see a fat piece of shit abusing the healthy functional body they were given, abusing the shit out of it. It aint right.god damn it
The humble brag that likes to bubble up in fatlogic is annoying and there are too many fat people who post fatlogic and don't get called out because most people there are fat.
Which songs?
&gt; No joke, our office had an outside wall which got very cold in the winter, and she would tape cheese and other perishables to the wall to keep it cold.wait, what?

I am so tired of seeing g tess monsters ugly fucking face and nasty flubber body.

That's really cool. I never thought of shears this way, which is fun.
Yep. My mother also suffers from fibromyalgia and she remains healthy and fit.
The pillow's nickname is "death."
i like it. :3
time for me to become an azn qtie! /snap
I don't get why people are averse to asking or answering their weight. If you weigh a lot, a little, or somewhere in between... it's going to be evident before you tell me a figure. I just want to know specifically or else I wouldn't ask.
Thank god. I couldn't stand any of the redneck comedians.
Yes, you're right. To solve world hunger.
I think what she's saying is that it's not thin privilege, it's fat consequences.
I wonder how much money/time fatties spend hiring people to take photos of them pretending to have lives
I think it's just another way we fit people can be condescending towards the fatties. It's a stupid phrase, but it's pretty representative of how ridiculous fat people sound.
I wouldn't even go as far as sex, how do they even reach each others lips.
Oh no, there's no doubt about it- he's definitely a dipshit for being with this whale. His IQ is lowered every moment he spends with it. But it will be okay once he moves on, his IQ will come back. And for bad breath, our local dentists highly recommend the purple listerine. Problem solved.
How does beautiful people get away with it? They are a business no?
Sadly, obesity is one of the few things that's actually non-partisan. On the other hand, shit-lording crosses party lines, too!

Act now or else she will get too big to handle. Just like when the ghostbusters tried to shoot the wall of slime off of the museum. Too goddamned fat.

Lol I don't understand this at all. 36 is fat and so is 38. Wtf?
I hope so too. Anyone who knowingly brings a convicted child predator around their kids doesn't deserve to have any. To make things even worse, the kid he went to jail for molesting was Fat Mama June's oldest daughter, Anna. So this guy molests her kid, goes to prison for it, and once he gets out she goes "Yeah, it's totally cool to date my daughters rapist. Especially since I have another kid the same age as she was when he molested her! Sounds great!"

I almost always drink almond milk after drinking soy for the first like 5-6 years of being vegan (options were limited in those days), but I've dabbled in all the different ones. I still always come back to almond. The Target brand of almond milk in unsweetened vanilla is my JAM. Hahaha.

Nope. But Reddit Is Fun is pretty good.
Yeah, I noticed when I started lifting seriously I slept more and couldn't stay up all night like I used to.
Except none of the fatties that gobble this shit up would actually do that, nor would they listen if you showed it to them.
Probably the same way in which places like A&amp;F and American Apparel handle this problem. Call your employees models so that you can hire based on physical appearance.
Who the fuck even says that. So fucking rude. They sound peanut butter and jelly. If they haven't eaten that too.
Costco is a great company but they keep the price low on chicken because it gets you in the store, not out of the goodness of their hearts.
Dear gawd people lighten up and stop it with the down votes. I'm Canadian and I got it. Maple leaf, maple sugar, not that big a leap.
That's not even shitlording... That's just common fucking sense that fatties refuse to accept.
The air of entitlement and whining is what i hate the most. If you don't fit in the world, you need to change not the other way around.
I like Now for their arts coverage and Dan Savage, which I can get online, but for the most part, it's a left-wing tabloid.
Yes hopefully, however the majority is fat so it'll be much tougher than vaccination requirements.
Bras exist for a reason
As someone who's pretty built, I didn't find this an accurate representation of my shape at all. I think it's more for people who don't really exercise or just do endurance exercise. Maybe it's different for a male?Edit: I did the same thing using my husband's stats and I think much of the difference comes to not being able to adjust shoulder width.
We can use her gravitational distortion to travel through time. Maybe to a future without lardbacks.
Piedmont...Where Nutella was born, where you eat cheese as a snack and where the most popular dish is the [bagna cauda](URLThe economy in the past was heavily based on livestock (cows mostly) and on the production of milk and cheese. Butter was a byproduct used widely because it was cheap and abundant.I looked up some recent stats, apparently obesity is up to 8%, now, still better than the rest of the state.
Great point.

I'd guess (without any background info) that seeing her mom fat has a lot to do with her thinness. Just like a lot of us verified shitlords.

She's not a good friend. Ditch her. I'm also a member of the no butt club. My sister makes fun of it all the time, and my mom does too, but not as rudely. My sister has a huge ass. She's huge all over. She can make fun of me, but God forbid I say something about her.

This already exists. These "what do you think of this shitlord sub" posts are becoming very annoying. If you want to make a sub, great, make it. Then share it and some will join others will ignore.

I seriously cant guess a gender, I want to say male but there aren't any definite characteristics under all that makeup and fat
Rise of fat pride. Yep on a par with gay pride because it's not like they had it any worse than fatties. /s
Perfect in the sense that we can use you as a food source if we need to emergency evacuate earth and run out of food supplies?I, by no means am morbidly obese but I am overweight. I wouldn't show off my yoga skills because I wouldn't want people getting blinded D : why do people do this ):
Engagement and wedding rings go on the left hand.
This is a needed sub. The other fat people subs are far too PC and feelings oriented.
Is there a source for this? I'd love to share this on my facebook. this pic just screams hilarity for me.I would rank Brussel Sprouts in my top 3 fav vegetables. a nice side with some sweet potatoes &amp; salmon, and there's a tasty healthy meal.
Family Member brings snacks to Patient dying of Obesity: OK! Assisted Suicide for the Terminally Ill: NOT OK! . One is just the slower version of the other....
From what I remember, they decided to classify obesity as a disease partly because they hoped people would get more serious about "treating" it. The hope was that, if people thought they had a disease, they'd follow the doctors treatments to "cure" it. Obviously it's not working.
Lol, because I smoke cigarettes? You sound like a baby.

Hah! WHALE!
Reminds me of Lost when a few people were finally like - what the fuck, we've been trapped on this island with little food and Hurley is still a fatfuck, he is definitely eating the stores in secret.
I live in the suburbs near Chicago and nearly every other person here calls themselves 'country'. The only time these people have been on a farm was on a school field trip. It's so annoying.
They usually have a sign outside or are labeled as family restrooms. They are meant for parents who are lugging around children and diaper bags or whatever else they have. I have found that when I take my son out for walks/jogs (usually go a couple miles to a shopping center and squeeze a quick errand in, like picking up random ingredients/items or prescriptions) if I have to stop at a bathroom, I now need to use the handicap stalls if there aren't family restrooms since I don't want to leave my kid or the jogger alone while I pee.
And yet ShitRedditSays is allowed to exist even though its only purpose is a call to brigade comments and other subs and its CSS is contructed in a way to alter the normal operation of reddit by manipulating the voting mechanism.

Seriously, what would he have done had he gotten a plate of veggies? Get mad? Not eat it? get agitated and flail around? Good, half those is 'exercise' and the other contributes to him losing weight. He can't run after you anyways.
Those are fabulous milestones...For a 6 month old.
The snack size is probably perfect for me. All that lactose makes me phlegmy as fuck
Fatties need to realize that if they want to walk longer it takes time. Its too hard, ugh.
I want my cat eye glasses and my lipstick and my corsets and my septum piercing back. Seriously I've been rocking this style since eighth grade and it pisses me off that tumblr made it a fat girl thing.
I'll bet you're the kind of plebeian who shops for clothes at TJ Maxx instead of the Gap. People who ask you what diet you're on may be fat, but at least they are stylish and trendy, and that's all that matters. Enjoy your discount diet, loser. You'll be all alone while the rest of us are partying at the most exclusive hospitals and assisted living facilities.
Her nipples are stretched to the size of frisbees.
I'd not only pitch in for this, I'd sit at the entrance of Wal-Mart and make sure only seniors and legitimately handicapped people get the scooters.
Mind I ask which chocolate starfish?
That's why I specifically made the point that no one is obligated to help anyone. OP went out of his way to change his lunch pattern to undermine the fatty, though. That is what I personally find repulsive and don't understand. I wouldn't want to eat shit every day even if someone paid for it and I would certainly give zero fucks as to what the fatty isn't stuffing into its gob any more. No disgusting fast food smells at lunch? No grease covered paws handling a client's documents? Great! Wunderbar! I just think if you hate something (fat people anyone?) it doesn't make sense to keep it around you longer than you absolutely have to instead of encouraging it.

This is a problem in a number of militaries. People want lots of women in the military, not many want to join, some that do aren't up to it and are used to getting away with murder. No one wants to be accused of sexisim so they never get called on their underperformance.As a result women in the military are mistrusted as no one knows if they are competent or just the right gender. This in turn perpetuates the idea that women aren't capable. Often in the military you don't get a second chance to be right.
Yeah, we're thinking of going 100% video chat or just hanging it up. Problem there is video is two-way and we like to do a little pre-qualifying to see where potentials rate on the psycho scale.I remember when those sites were like ordering off a delivery menu. Just not worth the effort where we live.
They drive the scooty puffs up to their cars, climb in, and leave them there in the middle of the parking lot, actually. I see it all the time.
At least now you can find someone who actually cares if you're attracted to them or not. My hubby originally called me shallow but seriously we can't control what turns us on! And the best part about her comment was that I still had a healthy bmi and she is in the morbidly obese category. I'm pretty sure she sees herself way differently than others do... probably because other people call her pretty to save her feelings :/
Thin privilege is being able to apply sunscreen with your hands
No really, it is easier to hide. I can gain or lose large amounts of weight without anyone noticing .. and not just water weight, shit I lost 6 pounds of that today on a 3.5 hour bike ride.
i don't smile because that's for pussies but i do flex and feel pretty good about it
How did she catch them though? It makes no sense.
It completely discredited itself by failing to understand basic statistics. Oh who am I kidding, it discredited itself in my eyes by being fat.
If we ate it, that size would feed my entire family of 3 ice cream for at least 2 weeks. It's amazing to think people can eat like that and not just drop dead immediately. Wow.
Sorry if I did offend you. But I have witnessed it first hand, my ex's brother. He was black, married to a filipino...she was not fat, just dumb as a door knob. She makes the money though. He just cheats on her all the time with all these women and has so many kids . And he wants to be a rapper....yeah. it's like these particular people choose those with low self-esteem to take advantage.
Wow, that must be heinously painful. Surely exercise would hurt less.
I love how the "fiancee" is fat, balding, and ugly with greasy hair and dirty glasses. Yea you know you're fuckin gorgeous when you snag a catch like him.
*type type huff huff* That'll show them. *wheeze*
you are an amazing person for doing all that you did for those kids. as for her.. i hope she dies in a horrible freak accident. that's what she fucking deserves.
My heaviest was around 125 pounds, which made me start to look fairly chunky at 5'1. I was in high school and had gone through a bad breakup, and just kind of let myself go. I would, however, still try to wear the tight old tank tops + skinny jeans I used to, and it really showed in one particular family photo. When I saw it, I felt so ashamed. I had love handles sticking out, and you could see the shape of my belly and my bellybutton through the tight shirt. I don't remember being out of breath or anything much, though I did feel hungry quite a lot and drank a soda or two a day back then.Now ~104 pounds after losing over the fall and winter and I look way better, and feel a bit more energetic.
6'3 guy here. I've always thought girls my height or taller were really hot, buuut they're not exactly easy to find. If only these hambeasts could eat themselves tall instead of circular.
Fatties camp. They get the biggest RVs and grill in the woods.
Absogoddamnlutely. Dogs are dogs are dogs regardless of what they're being trained to do and that goes for the rest of the animal community. They can all be equally loving and compassionate unconditionally to the right people
Aldi's Deutsche Kuche Fruits Of The Forest frozen strudels are really good. It's a special item, so I buy all of them when I see them.
I'd totally go for it, honestly the only thing holding you back are the whale tears. If you don't care what they think, and don't let whatever untrue bullshit they're probably gonna try to say affect you, then I think you got this.
[Then tattoo it on yourself.](URL
I seriously question the mental state of being of these beasts. There is NO way anyone can truly like how they look. Apart from a few whiteknights and your overly protective family/friends, NO ONE will think you're hot and NO ONE will pay attention to you, unless its negative. So how do these things get it in their fat minds that they can post shit like this and consider itselves sexy?Pshychology ~~majors~~ shitlords dont fail me now please.
I've heard about that gym before, in all honesty, they have a pretty smart business plan, they cater to a niche market that wants to give the illusion of working out in order to tell people that they did something in order to lose weight while doing nothing. Most of the members never go back to the gym after signing up which lowers the maintenance cost of the equipment. They have pizza nights and cost only 10$ per month, their aim is to keep everyone fat in order to get them to stay; they're going for the long con.Tldr: Planet fitness caters to a niche market, customers who don't actually want to work out.
[I got the double (w)hammy]( URL
a wise woman once told me"if you seek pleasure everywhere, you get pleasure no where"(christy0misty)instead of enjoying food, fats just do it through habit and greed.
Meh, I wouldn't consider myself to be even close to the strongest guy in my gym, I have a solid 6 pack, and am bulking up even further, yet my bmi is 25.5 which is in the overweight category.
You know I'm starting to wonder if the fat epidemic we're seeing will just work itself out over the next century (through them dying) and then be referred to as the Bubonic plague of this century a thousand years from now.
Pork is haraam for Muslims too.

You're probably right, I'm just sick of looking at these animals and want them to get on a treadmill for a few hours a day at least. Maybe you view it as sympathy but I just have ham fatigue and don't wanna look at fatties in tight black pants with stomach rolls hanging out anymore.
I have this type of talk (well now it's more like me sounding like a total bitch out of anger, thanks FPH ;) ) with my ham mom at least once a week. It does not work. You can't help people that do not help themselves. I know it's your father, he served for your country, and did other things for you and your family. But if talking isn't even helping him, I don't know what else will. I hate to be harsh, but probably nothing will change his ways at this point. BUT You can help yourself by looking through r/FPH r/talesoffsthate to see how others tolerate their fat families and friends. Also read some hilarious disgusting stories.Honestly, seeing the hatred for fat people on here has opened me up and comfortable with the fact my mom won't live much longer, and it's ok for me to be angry at her ignorance and lack of self care, and most importantly I am normal for having my strong dislike of obesity - and guhnetics are not real :p .Hope this helps a little.
&gt; "functioning"ahahahahahaThis, from the same people who constantly whinge about their joints hurting, their feet swelling, being out of breath? How do they miss the signs that their body is giving them: "I cannot function properly while carrying around 200 extra pounds"?I think it's because of the same thing we see over and over again: they've lowered the bar so much that what a word like "functional" means to them is so distant from what it means to us that it's a different language. Of course, though, they're deluded and gorged on the support of blubberbeasts just like them, they've forgotten what "normal" definitions are.Example: shitlord definition of *functioning*:  walk up 3 flights of stairs (if you have legs, let's say) without panting for breath, for starterstumblr hambeast definition for *functioning*:  having a heartbeatIt's the "everyone gets a medal" mentality, guys, except it's become "and you get two" - even though you didn't even participate in the event - "because you're the most special, squishiest snowflakes and ***you deserve it.***" I wish they'd grow up, but hey, I wish I could grow wings and fly, too, and that's not going to happen anytime soon. We must maintain our shitlording and shaming. It's the only way they'll see the light.Edit: missed a quotation mark
People call me shallow when I tell them the truth. I'd rather be alone for the rest of my life than ever touch a fat woman. Its fucking gross, repulsive and I don't care if fat women think I'm a shallow asshole for thinking that. Having standards is important and key to enjoying your life. Also, I always tell women there's plenty of fat lazy men who are more than happy to be their fatass man.
Fat people fail at life.

He even suggested the hookup first. Disgusting.
I was watching a documentary on pro-anorexia stuff yesterday and I had the thought that it's just like fat acceptance. These girls are hurting themselves by weighing so little, and people condemn the communities that encourage them to do it.Obesity is bad for your health, too, but no one can say shit against those communities or you're fat-shaming.

No I upvoted you. The fact is, not every single person that is disgusting has a mental illness. Some people are just disgusting thats and thats that.

You have every right to let him know that his Fatness = Grossness. You are not a bitch, you are simply being a prim &amp; proper ShitLady. He needs to know that it is not acceptable to break the contract he entered with you when you two got married — to stay hot and fuckable until death do you part. One **should never** have to say, *"Hey, you know what? I loved you then and I still love you now and find you hot even though I have to push aside your FUPA and use a vice grip to push down your pubic fat just to see the tip of your hard cock"*. Nope. No. Stand up for yourself and your happiness. Don't let your [potential] child emulate his behavior and turn into HamToddler. Edit: spellings stuff

She needs the calories, can't let it go to waste!
A train full of kids is about to run off a cliff, the bridge was destroyed by her arch enemy Lord Beetus (credit - /u/JDG43017). Zephyr flying enroute to save the kiddies. But wait, is that a KFC off in the distance? She hadn't eaten in like 20 minutes and didn't want to fade away. She hastily flew through the drive-thru ordered her family bucket and wolfed it down. Alas, her detour took too long, the train fell. The kids all died. "I was starving ^teehee "And that is how Zephyr saved the day.
I wonder if fat people realize that all their fat can render the drugs they take useless... Like birth control becomes less effective the more overweight you are (which is ironic because as the weight goes up the likelihood of them actually getting laid goes down).
She wasn't fat. At all. She had sad loose saggy skin from going from fat to thin.

I mean, she could be right. However, she is always inserting her pushy opinions on people. She has apparently lost a lot of friends because she can't deal with an opposing opinion. I guess this might not be the worst case of why fat people suck, but it's the first one I have ever experienced in real life.
Some of these actually made me happy, because I really hope they just went with a style that suits their body for now but they will take care of themselves later.Some of these made me really angry. Why do you get married when you don't have your life in control? I sure as hell want to get my food habits on track before I share my kitchen with my future husband. But as it seems, most of the men are little piggies so at least if only the bride and groom are in pictures they don't look oddly oversized.

One celery stick or 16 oz cup of diet coke with each meal negates any calories ingested!
I'm a feminist, too. I've taken a lot of courses on gender studies, sexuality and sexual behavior, pop culture critical analysis, etc. I think a lot of why so many people disassociate themselves from feminism stems from uneducated people hijacking the word for their own use. People are wrongly using the term and declaring themselves feminist, despite only having learnt about it from circle-jerk posts on tumblr. People then see the circle-jerking idiots as the face of modern feminism. But they're not. They're really, really not.
I always called them FlAbs.
Americans barely study their own history in the school system
man if only I could get penis gainz by eating
Fuck that, you can keep that pussy.
Agreed. If they wake up at 5 am it's because there's a sale at dennys.
It would be much better off cosplaying as a Volus.URL
Well, at least we agree on something. We all want her to live out in the middle of nowhere and leave us alone too. But instead she is just soaking up an ever-increasing amount of resources.
Yes facts are hate, why don't you change your diaper instead of creeping through my comment history.
There's hair on the entire visible "shin" I'm just gonna guess fatty couldn't reach it at all and just didn't shave.
Hams cannot pull off piercings. It just looks like they were so hungry they ate some metal item and pieces of it got stuck in their faces.
I find it hard to believe that the one with nurses isn't higher
The usual; that we are frustrated kids, probably fat ourselves, who can't even live in society without expressing our hate against fat people, that FPH is disgusting, etc...
Probably a comparable level to the amount of tears shed when their Doctors tell them they have Type II Diabetes.
What about black people? I have a theory we aren't supposed to eat a European diet at all. Elijah Muhammad wrote a book that is actually really good for maintaining a human diet. Despite what you may think about his religious and political views.
So. Punchable.
Fake or not, I'm literally laughing my ass off. I'm burning 100 calories per second that's so fuckin funny
Oh no, hurt feelings resorting to doxxing people. Whatever shall the world do with all these hams and their Google skills.

Stop oppressing me
I wish I had good news for you- my brother married an ugly, obese, gigantic fake blonde who managed to turn him against all of us. Now, she's pregnant and his fate is sealed. this is the fat bitch who isolate to every family party b/c they have to eat before they come and wraps up leftovers at the party to take home . We tried so many times w/ my bro, but he has been sucked into some fatosphere and he's lost....
Hubby's iron :) oh and uh...hehe...yes ma'am : )
Did you see it ungulate it's fat rolls in an attempt to attract a male obeast. Damn nature, You scary.
people dont like death grips here apparently
I dunno...that sounds hard. Can I have some money please?
I hope she washed the smell of sweat, grease and shame from the clothes before wearing them.
what an idiot-- lucifer is a key figure in esoteric hitlerism, aryan mythology.
I worked out today and taught kids how to climb rock walls, which sounds way better than taking instagram pics of myself and my huge fucking bingo-arms.
Thank you! It is the hardest language I've ever learned (to make it worse, I learned from British speakers, so I am doubly confused when I pronounce things different*ly* (adverb, right?) than my American friends. They stare at me when I say "*mobile* phone", for example. But yes, she seems delusional and entitled. Usually I'm not a judge of potential snu snu, but ick. :( You can already tell she's one of those fat attention-needy lesbians that need constant praise and reassurance. Ick x2.
I think you'll be surprised by how much you can do by just saying 'active'. My biggest way to do so is to dance at home, which lets me exercise and work up a sweat without concentrating on numbers. I need to start testing the limits of my body more, and giving myself a chance to get strong while I'm young
Seen a lot of fat Stormtroopers...Lord Vader would never have stood for that.
Something, something, Her body isn't our business. Her body is her own business. We have no right on dictating how she wanted her body to be. That's what the fatty said.
Couldn't even touch fingers on her right hand. No matter how simple the task these fat fucks will find a way to cheat and cut corners.
I need to be honest here... this is the first time I've ever felt ill looking over a post.Don't get me wrong- I've seen quite a few disgusting, overweight subhumans posted in /fatpeoplehate, but this one... this one actually made me nauseous.
I was bullied for being weird, I would like compensation in the form of kitchen gear.
"Because of my hips"No honey, it more than just that.
yeah thats fair, heres more diz to make up for it URL
This is it right here. You can search for that 'missing piece' in food, drugs, religion. The reality is that that piece is realising your full potential as a human, emotionally, intellectually and physically.
A friend of mine does research for USC's Keck, he's been devoting his time towards an interesting correlation between cultures that eat less gluten and low rates of Alzheimer's/dementia. I've seen some of his research, there's something to it...
Yeah hahaha. I agree.
you little shitlord.
Damn autocorrect!
"fitted"LOL.
Dude, that thing needs an NSFW tag. How does it even walk out the door thinking that's what right looks like?
Fuck i was eating something when i read this.
gross.
I mean I'm a male and I'm 6'2" and weigh 220lbs, but I work out every day for fb, so I don't actually have that much fat.
Im not sure where it comes from but it's damn annoying. I don't scrutinize every meal my co workers eat, or what they do after or before work. Why do they care what I do?
Please wear fire.
?if you are a feminist and believe in equality you would care about male issuesAlso why did you say "wahhhhhhhhhh"are you saying men dont have problemsBecause as a women I cant get behind misandry like that
Look at her pic. She still looks fat
I have developed an absolute hatred for Wings since the whole bootcamp thing. I had hit rock bottom, and decided that I would do the weight lose journey with him. Here I sit, 100 pounds lighter, while he has thrown away everyone and everything that could help him.This subreddit is a constant reminder of what I've been, what I am, what I never want to be again, and what I won't be tomorrow.Godspeed, shitlords.
Apparently its not in the sidebar anymore
Holy holy mother of fuck.
It's definitely a thing. A guy I work with is a power lifter and was told he couldn't use the gym because he was too "intimidating".

You Kurt and Pete lolz
Set-point theory is false.Next.
Fuck off and die fatty. Enjoy your loose skin marking you forever you disgusting piece of inhumane trash.
Clearly the best corse of action is to pretend that being fat is okay. That'll make them want to loose weight because..... Reasons.
&gt;Are you going to keep arguing that she had NO malice whatsoever?I'm not saying that there isn't some schadenfreude involved, but the *only* reason these cookies are detrimental is because of *the rest of their diet*. That is to say, if the people eating these cookies had a healthy diet, the cookies would not contribute to anything more than a snack in the day. These cookies aren't laced with poison. The cookies in and of themselves aren't causing the damage.
Run.
Get out of here with your logic. ^^^^token ^^^^/s
Op pls
But still not a pleasant surprise
Kids change the equation drastically. Thankfully I'll never have them.
I doubt anything is suiting for her.
Where I'm from, we have a tax funded public healthcare system which makes it all the more enraging.So many fucking back injuries and new machines being invented just to lift a whale out of bed and into a two seater wheelchair to wheel them over to the toilet so they can expel the most foulest substance you can imagine.Then to have the kids come in and my first thought "I'll see you in a few years."
Yeah, I mean it took me a while. But as this sub gets bigger, the reddit brigade will bitch about us being secretly fat and self-haters. The more people with flairs, the easier it is to dispel that notion.

How old are you? I'm a big "jump rope is the best convenient" cardio guy. $10 gets you all the equipment you need and you can use it anywhere, it's just not ideal for older knees.
It is similar enough that you can actually overlay the pictures like one of those stereoscopic images. Only thing different is the folds in the shirt, otherwise they are almost identical.
Or nothing stretches and the penis is so far inverted into the body that all you can see is the ridge of a bellybutton-like hole...

Absolutely no effort into Poison Ivy. All she did was make ask l her skin green, slapped on a red wig, and squeezed into cheap dark green lingerie.

Why do I feel like this exact phrase has been said before by someone who was serious
&gt;This is my body.Big whoop. Do you want a fucking medal for having a meatsuit?
I'm more concerned about all the likes she got. One stupid person is expected but 41?! We're doomed
Omg. How do u even find a partner who is not fat if you're above 20.
A BMI of &gt;35 is morbidly obese...
Today was the first day of the semester that she didn't bring snacks. Usually she has a bag of chips, a candy bar, and a soda.
It is sad that they photoshopped the pics and thought "yep, this is good" when they got to the results you posted. Keep going dude, it is still fucking ugly.
What's her snapchat?
Her BMI is in the obese range smh
The news in nyc adopted this method a few years ago. So many male suspects in wearing hoods.
Ja. Not curved. Fat girls are curved. Curvy girls are curvy.

You don't understand what's gross about hydrogenated flavored bean oil as frosting for a cookie? I guess we have different palates. I'd rather just spend an hour making homemade cookies or go to a bakery. Guess I'm just old fashioned like that.

"Obese" isn't only way to be fat.
I don't know who this bitch is but that face is nightmarish.
Looks more like a hamstring pull, but the rest i agree with lol
Fat. That is what is stopping you.
Holy shit. The delusion is real.
And what's truly sad is that some obese people accept this and would rather eat eight years worth of food in one year than to live an extra 8 years.

Cookie Monster is a shitlord now though. Promotes vegetable eating. XD
I really wish there was a PF close to me.Free massages, free pizza, crazy cheap? I'd sign up so fast.I'm going to assume the equipment is always free too
I would think that should be the best form of motivation for them rather than cling onto it. The bit of bullying I received (not fat related) only pushed me to work harder in all faucets of life post public school.

Catching them in mid-feed is always bonus points. :)
She looks like she could choke olmec
How many pounds are in a stone?
I fucking *love* some cheesy pick up lines, but delivery is everything. You can't do that shit over text. I've used all the classic, lame as fuck lines and had them work beautifully because in person I can include a sly grin and a follow up. It probably also helps that I'm attractive and not 400 lbs.
Now I want to pee on his pizza.
At the least, she has to be a 14. I have yet to see anything run more than 1 size bigger than I normally wear. She likely is one of those hammies that wear jeans you have to lie down to zip because she insists shes a size 10
Actually yeah I was wearing a tank

I'm pretty sure I could do one then I would get sick after that
Now this would be a great "Guess the Gender" contestant.
The toilet was bad already. But now she's got the water rising from Under25BMI.Nobody's safe.
As someone with an interest in fashion, god fucking dammit.

I was too fed up to want do that
I joined a few weeks ago at 100,000, nice to see some growth. Being nice to ham planets doesn't work. I believe in this system.
If there's one thing you can learn from history is that people dont learn all too much from wars. And get complacent with small scale conflicts.
I'm hoping for that now!
One dedicated troll, excellent work. I wonder if some stupid obeasts will believe this.
Good. Hopefully it was a fat person.
...so what's your point?
Fat family members are a bitch, bro.
I will bet everyone that comes here that OP is the girl in the picture and she's going to do an update after this gets enough comments saying she 'tricked' us or is trying to fish for compliments. EDIT: Do I win something for calling that 30 seconds after she posted it? I'm good at this internet thing.
... bread?
Although I'm reasonably cute and getting in better shape, my perfectionism prevents me from really saying to myself "damn I'm hot" ... although I'm sure my guy friends and boyfriend would tell me I'm hot, or so I hope, I can really see and scrutinize every flaw, every scar, every stretch mark, every spot of fat, every muscle group that's lagging in gains... you get the idea -_-A lot of shitladies love the extra attention that comes with their hard-earned bodies, which is great. I however am not among that number.
Better all over her shirt than actually all over her. The concentration of mass, resulting in a singularity may doom us all!
She needs to loosen the straps and have the baby sink into the carrier more. Right now he's splayed against her, what a carrier is supposed to do is keep the baby in a seated position like a piggy back ride.

Off my fupa.
Man, that must suck. I think this post will give me nightmares.
It's not the mean old social worker being negligent, a lot of places they're understaffed. For instance my home county has a rate of 50 cases per worker.
Let me guess...it only wants a tall and fit guy, right?
Are these people blind? If you're a dude and you have tits, you're fat. If your body shape is "potato", you're fat. You're gross and we don't fucking want you here.
It's so satisfying looking into her eyes and seeing how she just knows she's dead inside and her life has no meaning.
Fuck, why did I think it was a good idea to come here during lunch? Almost barfed
That was, for some reason, more disgusting than most fat pics I've seen.
Let's make it happen!
I thought dessert was one of those things you get when you're out for a celebration with like six people and you share it. Who has room for that shit multiple times a week?? I have a soup or salad and my main entree and I'm full as fuck.
Don't forget about /r/TalesofFatHate !
That's the whole point they try to make &gt;these are people who never had to struggle like rick and the gang&gt;see how far rick and friends have come. Aren't they badass?Puh-fucking-lease. That show is built for morons, our they think the viewers are too retarded to notice their dumb shit/ plot holes.Either way its the only zombie apocalypse show out there...
Wow. One of these hams brought together two of the things I hate most: obesity and horrendous poetry. That was not a poem. Can these fat fucks do anything right?
there is no way in hell I am burning to death bc of fatass. he is on the floor being ran over
What a load of crap. Seriously now, can you imagine any judge convicting someone of raping her?. Seriously though, this post should be removed as it is beyond stupid.
It is true! I signed up there like a few weeks ago, and they were explaining everything to me, and the manager goes, "And don't forget to come in every first Monday of the month! That's free pizza day! We load you up with carbs and work you out till you're exhausted." I still can't believe it. I haven't participated in pizza Monday's...
My question is this; is it safe to have an open flame in such close proximity to that much flammable fat?
I'm appalled. This is one of the gnarliest pictures I've seen in awhile. I'm..I don't even know...
Omg you're right! Lol! Now that's all I'm gonna think of when she speaks. Hahahah
You can't fake fat. Or she is the most dedicated troll in the history.
*Obtain a whaleFTFY
It's not so much a not noticing as it it not giving a fuck
Is her head shaved? Or is just a terrible PCOS weave?
They also might become shitlords in the process, learning to hate their previous fat lifestyle. I'd say any change that is not entrenched in fallacies or misinformation like most fatties is a good change for a fat one.
Nope, servant of Slaanesh. Should be obvious, by the username.
You know, if they spent all the time they need to come up with these sort of stupid quotes at the gym, they would be thin in no time.
So heavy his legs are bowed.... &lt;-- there is a christmas joke in there somewhere
I don't know what those things are so I'll assume they are your sex toys.
It is when they're fat \**circlejerk intensifies*\*
Nasty
"I also thank that it's crap that I can't do something amazing and be celebrated and, you know, people talk about the changes i'm making instead of my size." The amazing thing she did was get signed to a modeling agency while being morbidly obese but she wants people to tell her that she's making changes and that she's a revolutionary beauty icon while not focusing on her weight.
Its true, currently at my Walmart the diet Coke is 25 cents more than the regular coke.
Hm.1. Are you trying to move too much weight? Trying reducing the weight and see if that helps. You may be going for too much too soon.2. Eat something small, maybe cottage cheese and some apples. It'll give you a good combo or protein and carbs.
Someone better fix it for me because it damn sure isn't my responsibility.
But why would you want to support them?
No fetish porn sites! teehee!
Agreed. The hams set up a situation for OP that is almost lose-lose. If she fights back : it creates drama and tension in the workplace. If she does nothing: she's the office pariah and the workplace is stressful. Not only that, the hams could use this a precedent to further blackmail/defame her. These are truly awful people. They are causing trouble for no reason other than their own selfishness.OP, if you continue to work there and *best case scenario* make 'amends' with the Judas Ice-cream-chariot, do so. But not really. Always hold the grudge like the Shitlord of Monte Crisco. Let time pass like the above person stated, then when the ham is at it's lowest: BAM! Right in the folds!
&gt; Tbh, I think that's where a lot of this behavior stems from- parents who invested waaaaaaay too much in the self-esteem movement. Yes. The Tublrinas would be about the right age for it. I don't see FAs or Tublrinas my age though it's possible that's partly because obese people simply don't live that long.&gt;They gave their kids everything, validated and calorically indulged every feeling no matter how irrational it was, and threw a party for every minute behavior, so now their grown children demand constant attention and validation from everyone, and are able to get it because of everyone's access to digital media.Yep. And most of them are unemployed possibly because holding down a job is impossible for someone who thinks that constant praise and validation for the slightest accomplishment is their due in life.&gt; So when we wonder why hamplanets value imaginary internet points, and clearly don't understand that we don't, this is why- it is them living out their lives the way they always have, but through a different means.Very true.&gt; It never fails to amaze me that so many people seem to think that they can treat their kids like interplanetary gods, but expect them to grow up to be normal, productive people.And lots of the Tublrina hams are still being supported by their parents. I wonder if their parents *still* think they're the most pwecious widdle yooneek snowflakes in the world now that they're in their 30s and still living at home while spending their days shopping for cute clothes and eating and posting on Tublr!
At 5:55 the way it fails at saying "description" made me want to gag.
Erekt
No it belongs here I hav no idea wut the fuk is goin on but you are right and they are wrong
i agree, but she'd get the box of mini corn dogs (4 packs to a box, 10 in each pack?) and that would be her meal. so like 40 mini corn dogs for any given lunch or dinner
I'm all for fatshaming but he'll still put your ass in physical therapy. Scary as fuck. At least you can more easily run away?
I've never heard that but wouldn't be shocked to find that it was true, my son was 9 pounds 3 ounces at birth which is fairly larger than normal but I still found it strange that size 12 months onesies fit him.
Oh come now, swoledier, you should know that they don't walk at all. That's what taxpayer-funded scooteypuffs are for.
This was a GI's office. There is no excuse to whine over being asked to walk through a door. There is no excuse to be that fat, ever. When your legs buckle when being asked to stand because of fat, you deserve to be judged. This beast literally blocked the only door that went in or out. They had to call "her" in first because it refused to move and was tripping normal patients.
That's a weird way to spell "shower curtain"
I bet he's looking at cook books.
Stupid assholes are oblivious. Conscientious people are aware.
Doesn't seem like a joke to me considering the original responses and the shit I am getting for even saying that original statement of mine.
When you're a whale, anything less than you seems thin by comparison. How pathetic they all are.
That's what I like about this pic. How any brief concern as to how both genders look the same is overridden by fuckit, just take them out.
she's probably placing her order at Domino's
gross fucking gross blob blob of shit vomit inducing fat fuck lardy lardy girl repellent girls with guts
&gt;Do people not understand obesity is a DISEASE?I know, right? Since when is it a MD's job to treat diseases? Just shut up and tell me my stool looks OK so I can get back to Papa Johns, I put in an order before I came here.

Thank you so much for removing these sympathizers from this thread and sub.
Or he just got distracted and wrote down the number of happy meals he ate today.
She could have fallen on a whale and injured the majestic beast
It depends how much, how often, and how old. In much of the developed world it is normal for teenagers to have wine with meals from time to time, or the odd pint of beer.OTOH, giving piss-water like that to anyone is plain mean.
Classic Snorlax
I almost down voted that from how much it pissed me off. That chick is pretty close to immobile and she thinks that's cute
A WHOLE BOWL?! Holy SHIT. That's like, THE ENTIRE RECOMMENDED SERVING.
It is hillarious....today I walked past her down the hall....i moved over so she could pass....she still had to squeeze her way along the wall to get by.
Was she really expecting people to be all "youre beautiful idk why guys arent messaging you?!". Dont ask for peoples honest opinions if youre going to attack them for telling you. Delusional
The phrase "wallowing in their ignorance" seems so appropriate when applied to hams.
Why does the one on the right have a thigh for an upper arm?
Someone just lost her sharpie privileges
I blame that mistake on my youth (at the point of discovery). I thought the world a place where morbidly obese people were in no way enjoyed or appreciated.
Mmmmm, nothing like the taste of freshly grilled sea kittens!
Might need a NSFW tag on this.
Oh sorry, I didn't know you were looking for a discussion, you just asked for information.. my bad.Anyways, artificial sweeteners (or at least more toxic ones like aspartame) are pretty much universally regarded as detrimental to your health. I'm sure their are some that aren't that bad, but the ones usually found in things like diet soda are of the harmful variety.
They would be right if you wanted to bulk up, then you should eat more, but in a balanced diet high in protein and calculate your BMR and macros.May you never sway from the iron path of Brodin. Wheymen
You step outside, you get triggered. You take a drink of water, you get triggered. And nowadays you breathe, and you get triggered. Every moment now... you don't have a choice.
TIL baby bumps are not visible through fupa
24 inch pythons, brother!
Case in point, this fat piece of shit living in Hong Kong could only find sex through prostitution, and then brutally murdered two girls.Most fatties I know are quick to anger, and tend to be less rational than a fit person would be. Anybody could be a murderer, but in this case, it seems like he probably had low self esteem, and resented women (or just other people). Hope he rots in jail, and gets taught a few lessons by the inmates.
lol...but we really want to know is did the asian chick get fat?
If she keeps her mouth shut, doesn't whore for validation, who cares. But this place is pretty outstanding fitspo otherwise, more so than that namby-pamby handholding they seem to do there.
Is that thing on the left a male or female? And the girl on the right is an eyebrow-less monster. Absolutely disgusting.
Learn to delight in his fat logic. At this point in my life I'd not want to crush my brain and ligaments playing inside linebacker, but it can be fun as hell to watch someone destroy themselves for my casual entertainment.
So, I'm not usually into the 'guess the gender' jokes, but that's a good one. A+
Only 9?Also good for him!!
&gt; food lobby would never let that shit happen. That's why the campaign to fight childhood obesity is pretty much just "Umm, exercise more? BUT STILL EAT ALL OUR FOODS". Food industry saw the coming storm and made sure to get in first.
Refuse to acknowledge their existence. Or when I see them, I shout "OMG! I'm so fat! I need to lose weight!" as I walk by

There's no 'I' in 'Denial'.
Oh, my bad. Sorry. I've never seen Dr. Who. I'm on Tumblr and that entire fandom is fucking insufferable so I avoid the show and most of the people who watch it.
A 1 would be a guy who's as fat as they are.
I have no idea what I just watched......
THey do understand that they are literally paying (im assuming) a decent amount of money that goes directly back to the pockets of those who wrote and published the book.
pardon my noob question but are you(as the sub FPH) actually getting in trouble for linking other subs?
I'm a Hispanic male dating a white Jewish girl. I'll bet my bottom dollar that our relationship is healthier^^teehee than hers.

Oh dear lord...
I'd love to shoot her with an elephant hunting rifle, wouldn't do any damage to a whale.
If these upper class straight white people don't stop crying privilege I'm going to lose my fucking mind.
I prefer beer, vodka, wine and boobs after dinner.

Just make sure you are there to support your mother, your grandma is already dying a slow death. Let her rot in her own bitterness and faeces.
I made less than $10,000 last year and my husband less than $20,000, and we don't qualify for anything. We used to have insurance and food stamps but not anymore, and that's *fine*, because it's only there to be used when you need it and not any longer.But whatever, as long as fatasses like this can get what they 'deserve' then I guess it doesn't matter!
Oh no, this is the good ol' "hey look at how quirky and like one of the guys I am! I'm HILARIOUS and guess what...a tongue ring so you *know* I suck cock like a champ" move. I'd put solid money on it there's a giant tat either covering a fat tit, an upper thigh or the side of the ribcage in addition. Those are the usual distraction attempts they employ to try and get guys to not notice the fat right below the tattoo. "Oh is that a fat roll? Nah it's just a flower on a vine, I can still fuck this"
That's so stupid. Thigh gap is purely the shape of your pelvis. I have muscular thighs from a lifetime of sports reliant on squatting. I've always had a thigh gap. I'd have to be obese not to. Vagina is also very tight. Sorry fatties, you're wrong.
Fatties still don't believe all that extra weight causes any undue strain.
It was indoor. The stuff could stick to the wall if you tossed it. Since the price drop in CA it now sells at 220 a oz as top shelf club weed.
The worst part is that she is a doctor who bitches about fit people shaming people with their fit lifestyles.
Sounds divine. I haven't made homemade crackers before, I'll have to look into it.I make my own sweet potato hummus - mashed sweet potatoes, cumin, lime juice, garlic, sea salt, pepper. Mix and mash WELL. Boom.
&gt; I was raped when I was still around 5 years old. But the fatties (fat logic) thinks it's a good thing cause I attract attention and they don't.Holy shit get over yourself.
Agreed. I work on the 10th floor, I take the stairs both ways every day, on top of training a minimum of 3 days a week.
One would think she got fat implants
She's just terrible. Yeah, sure, let's reinforce a princess mentality in undeserving oinkers. Why not.
Oh my god that poor little girl. Fed half to death by a fat fuck mother, and she'll likely have problems with her health for the rest of her life because of it. Overfeeding your child should be punished in the same way starving a child would be - hopefully that way some children would be saved from abusive homes before they got this bad.
Don't worry little shitlord. It's gone
Holy fuck. THAT is the face it makes when it's hungry. Everyone get out of here quick!
Does she think using emojis will somehow make us think she's cute? Also, the turnabout on that worm insult was deliciously brutal.
and just why some medical board relevant?
"You're rejecting me cause I'm fat???"That is precisely the reason.

It's a hell of a workout having to lift the ~100 gallons of soda from the shelves into the cholesterol cart, too. Combine that with walking through the store and that's basically a marathon AND weight training. I wish I were so diligent with my exercise.
Wow. how is that possible? One hard boiled egg is almost 100 calories???
Hmm. Well, I pretty much just eat when I'm hungry and I'm not hungry very often. And I eat mostly veggies, fruit, beans, and not a ton else. I've been like this for the past 2 or 3 weeks, so I'm not super concerned I guess.
Being able to take ten steps without being out of breath. Hams are that out of shape.
I don't date using the web, but i dont judge.Its a new time grandpa, and hiding?Wow... with such a view on the world, so sad.Im going to stop talking to you now, before your, well, you, rubs off on me.Ugh, just the thought make me sick.
I fucking lost it at "Cholesterol Colossus." Brilliant.
I think im turning gay for that mans quads
This post made me mad
Scumbag feeder wife. These fatties are addicts and they're slowly enabling their early death. They're even worse in my opinion.
Abortion laws that are in their favor. That is for good reason. In case you meant that. Men and women are equal by the law there is no denying that. Or did you have something else in mind?
In all likelihood I weigh under half of most of th obeasts likely to brag about this, and I still can lose that sort of weight faster for longer...
I had a post where the whale woman I posted was jumped in and claimed to be below 18 (not to my knowledge), which was recently removed a good 3 or 4 hours ago, so I guess that the update is in relation to that.
Poor form and she probably ate a whole days worth of calories after such a "tough workout "
Looks like he needs those 38x14.50 tires to keep himself up there...
Good on her...Now keep pressing and convert her fully...
There's nothing like a fat dude who can't get it up due to lowered blood flow. mmm sexy
Fats sure love trying to stuff themselves into clothing. It's like a competition among them.
The escalators lead to a wood chipping machine.
I feel sorry for that &gt;100cc motor. The definition of torture.
You are the "Actually..." person.
&gt; But most Christians I know look forward to the day that God creates a perfect body for them. You were given one to begin with!And just imagine what they'll do to the next one, as well.
I agree on that in terms of bullying for weight, though there's other things people will bully you about that might be worth at least educating them on why it's bad. I was a lower-middle class student at the only school with an optional program in middle school, and that school was out of town where the median household income was triple mine. Classist bullying can't really be avoided by the target.
The struggle is real
She's right! I'm a size 12 too (American sizing)! I'm also over six feet tall...
Also never been, I live in Switzerland, IMO the shit-lordiest country of all :)
Yup! I've been lurking here, fatlogic, and fatpeople stories for about a year, while in the process of losing weight. Did I ever post here? Nope, because I was still a fatty mcfatfat. Didn't matter how much I was losing, I was still obese, then overweight, then high normal. Honestly, I used this sub as motivation. To know that every time I step foot outside, someone was disgusted by me. That my mere presence offended people. And being the huge people pleaser I am, I had to change that. Plus I was scared that my picture would show up here one day.90 pounds later I am finally at shitlord status. I've been maintaining at 128 at 5'7 for the past 3 months. Didn't create my alt account until today because I wanted to make sure I wouldn't slide back into ham-dom. Plus thanksgiving is coming up, and around this time last year I was a hammy, so I need to keep my self in check.A lot of people in those other subs brag about how they're not a deathfat. Doesn't matter, you're still fat. Or they brag about how they're working on losing weight and they just lost 6 pounds (with 144 to go). Fuck that. They probably just took a massive dump or something. I hate fat people, even as a former fattie, probably more so than those who have been shitlords their whole life. I know the laziness, the backassward logic, the victim mentality, the blame game and all the horrible things it takes to get fat and stay fat. I also know what it takes to drop the pounds, and it's honestly not that hard. So I feel ZERO pity for them or my former fat self.
Just got the same ones in that bright orange that Nike loves. They are glorious. They are actually designed to help change pronation problems to force a more neutral run. I'm hooked for sure.
First comment ever on Reddit, just because that was glorious and made me laugh.

Oooh wait, so I can just give a nice home to a tapeworm in my intestines, and I can eat whatever and how much I want? Sign me up! /sSad thing is, an obeast would probably seriously consider something like this. :/

Do her eyes work? If so, does her brain work?
I was also comepletely relaxed, the photo is cell phone quality, and it's not a side view to see the muscle separation. I find it hard to believe you can determine the strength of my arms from a crappy cell pic with no side view or flex
They're like muscular little hotdogs

They aren't ever my friends, but sometimes several of my friends will have a fat friend and I'll be stuck with them in social outings. They always seem to be really loud and annoying and wanna sleep with every guy in sight.

You're 15, isn't this subreddit 18+?
Her profile goes on to say that she wants her future mate to be "everything a girl could ask for" but that she only has a "few extra pounds". Sickening.
Holy shit those after abs tho :thumbs_up:
Despite all my rage, I'm still just a fat in a cage
I can't wait til it keels over and dies.

The amount of non-verified users in this thread disturbs me...and makes me slightly suspicious.
Fat racists are my favourite fatties. They just make me feel so great.
"Hammer up girl"
People like this are the the reason that violence should be quickly introduced. They have no problem running their mouths, swearing in front of kids (and at one point waving her hand at the kid), getting in the wife's face. They do this because there is no physical threat of violence. I'd love to see her try this with some guys pounding their loud stereo. She only did this because she was pretty sure there wouldn't be a physical altercation.I'd pay money to watch the wife smash this stupid cunt's face in.

Goddamn. I'm so sorry to hear this. I haven't been around too long, but I've seen her posts and enjoyed them. She sounds like she was a true badass and I'm not sure I've ever been sadder for someone I never met.
One call that's all! Morris Bart will help you sue anyone for anything.
I also thank you for your hard work. The censoring, however, was based on age, not weight. Anybody I suspected being even close to under 18 I blacked out.Submission checklist and all. Didn't want this ham fest to get deleted.

Fatties and creeperism aside, I actually quite enjoy the composition of this pic. Like it's a postmodern art commentary on the age of social media or something.....
It's not the conclaves so much as the fat rolls on knuckles.
Protip: people who exercise regularly do not refer to it as such. (They say "I play soccer!" or "I lift!")
None of those girls should ever go sleeveless.
If you're going to repost this for the 100th time, at least make it the one with the fedora.
I think every themed-costume community has that problem.
How much trouble?
Good shitlording but that ham probably doesn't have more muscles than you anyway.My Sister-In-Law is obsessed with thinking her massive ham arms are muscles, her arms are easily 3x the size of mine but hers are pure fat. Everytime I've seen her she tries to get me to fight her or do a show of strength so that she can show her "strength." One time she pushed me to show me how "weak my stance was" - we were walking in a grocery store, I don't know what the fuck kind of stance I was supposed to have. She pushed me as hard as she could when I wasn't paying attention but I still kept my ground, in retaliation I grabbed her arm and tripped her. First thing she does is start crying and saying she's going to sue me and immediately a couple comes up to me and tell me that they're willing to back me up if she even tries and that they saw her push me.She immediately forgets about the entire thing and just says that "I caught her off guard" and that she'll get me one of these days.**TLDR:** Hammy arms are not muscle arms no matter how hard they pretend they are. Keep up the shitlording OP.
Shes like the laziest type of fatty. Shes probably only 6/9 months of hard work and will power away from not being fat. But in 6/9 months this bitch will be 30 lbs heavier. Get off your ass and shut the fuck up.
Who is that? Quite a few people have been submitted here repeatedly so I'm not totally certain who is who.
If you think that is obese you are almost as bad as the fatties claiming to be 'normal'.
This is an 18+ subreddit.

"A fat person bragging about having big boobs is like a homeless person bragging about having the whole week off."
Wow, I didn't even think about that. Guess I'm naturally body positive in a shitlord way. Neat.
She's so fat that an extra ass starts to grow on the front and eventually turns into a gunt
Listing the time instead of the distance surefire means she walked half a kilometer.

Well I am now. Thanks for warning though!
Oh god, you think that's upsetting? I'm in the Navy. Fat people happen, and it's sickening. There was this one guy I knew who's uniform would pull on the buttons. Like... the buttons straining to keep it together.

Haha, googled her and found the tag 'punk will never diet". Snorted soda out my nose. Thank you for that :)
It irritates the fuck out of me. It's the worst sort of fat logic and everyone seems to treat it like a real "condishun." Every time I see someone call fat asses addicts in this sub I die a little inside.
Hams forget that 40 is hardly old for people who take care of themselves.
I mean, it's not like we're broadcasting any of our hate to the world. It's limited to our little community of shitlords and ladies.
Still sad boobs
There's a legal assistant I saw today at work who is so goddamned fat she's not even walking anymore. It's like she's fucking slinging her fat from side to side in some pathetic attempt at a waddle. I agree with you. If you're that fat that even fucking walking is that challenging, you're pretty much a lost cause at that point. I wouldn't have hired her, I can tell you that much. Nothing like hiring a fat slob to make your business look good, right?

There are a few feminists and trans people around here, and we do our best to call out the bigots. Unfortunately it looks like it didn't go well for you in this instance.
Lessons learned here too :/
Do not get me wrong, I love working out. It is my therapy. But NOT eating is the best of you are losing weight. My favorite example of this is marathon day. I ran a goddam marathon and burned around 3000 calories. The flip side of that is how easy it is for these hams to eat 3000 calories, even just absentmindedly. So are they going to run a fucking marathon to combat that? Just stop the constant consumption of calories.
I suppose her hide could upholster a nice sofa. That would be beautiful.
Banned for sticking your dick in haraam.
As long as what they hear aligns with their own beliefs too might I add, if it discourages their lifestyle they will ignore it even when given strong evidence. FatLogic is killing the USA
Pork rinds and fat ass behinds.
Not sure what it reminds me of. Just came to say that when your boobs are bigger than your head you should probably stop eating.
I feel badly for the medical student or junior nurse who is roped into 'helping' with the c-section and ends up spending the entire case holding up the belly so the surgical team can do the operation.
It's crazy how angry people can get over facts
Women have this problem too (not on Grindr of course). And we usually don't want to see dicks on our phones. Unsolicited dick pics are the worst.
That's exactly what I was thinking, like some kind of ghostly look.

When I was 19yo I worked in the downtown district. In a corporate office.......'s cafeteria......washing dishes. I grew up in the city and was pretty use to the homeless ppl. At the time I was an idiot and smoked a pack a day. I remember going outside on my 30min lunch break to chain smoke and I would be bombarded with homeless people hanging out trying to grab a free smoke. One time I gave in and let a dude have one. He sat down. Next to me. And then continued to tell me the chronicle of how he ended up where he was - it started off pretty "lost my job" type of thing but then he got all street crazy. I was tuning in and out until I heard the phrase "and that'd why I don't eat sandwiches. They cause cancer." To this day when I see anyone making a sandwiches I go off on a random rank about sandwiches just to honor that crazy dude. But truth be told I have little sympathy for most of the wanderers. I understand that there are some that really have just had the worst of luck (anything that can happen will happen) but MAJORITY of these people are lazy. Plane and simple. They DONT want to work. I have a friend that's homeless and he's a pure example. Airhead since high school - never wanted to work - only wanted to party - and that's what he's doing; just floating. Sometimes on the streets, sometimes on a friend's couch - he doesn't give a shit. Has a new phone number every other week because he keeps getting burner phones. Idk. Think I went on a rank. Anywho:Fuck that fat lazy bitch. I get pissed when I see this shit and I get even more pissed when I see people at the supermarket buying bullshit like pop tarts and cookies with food stamps. Peace be with you all :)
My nuts will go nowhere near such a filthy place.
If that's what they're willing to do at work imagine how their own homes look....gross.

Does anyone else feel the urge to push it into a deep hole covered by 24/7 CCTV cameras and just watch the fat melt off its body over the course of months?And then, after releasing it from its pit of "agony" looking fairly svelte, you lead it to an all-you-can-eat buffet, and watch it gorge itself on shit food to the point that its shrunken stomach ruptures. The thought of a fatty *literally eating itself to death* amuses me.
Her cheek fat is so heavy, her smile has trouble lifting up.

If you burn up all your glucose exercising, your body is gonna burn fat while you're sitting at your desk or sleeping on bed. Don't matter.
What a waste. fat people should be burned outside in a pit. They didn't live a dignified life they don't need a dignified burial.
I'd say you're probably good enough to be verified since you actually look like a person. Also, I'm glad you know what I mean in regards to tossing em around. Then they get that leg wrap going and...I uh...I need a quick trip to the shower.
Attention.
Just watched her sing for the first time and she's not even good. Like Adelle's fat but she can actually sing. If Simon Cowell could judge her she'd never make it anywhere
What about all the other mods? =(
I'm shocked she isn't stuck in that position.
Also stairs. Stairs everywhere to get on everything. That's enough of a deterrent.

I saw some old commercial/parody show that used that sentence. It was about a woman wanting to lose weight and then the narrator told her that there's an easy way which was to eat less and move more. The woman thought/believed it was a scam and went back to stuffing her face with a bunch of chocolates
How many butthurt tubblets and whiteknights came out to cry?
It's fucked. I actually had (now former) friends that did this irl. Yeah, been nice knowing you.
How does she look like a skank?
Yeah. Try having a fairly obvious deformity that you can't get rid of and see how much your school experience sucks you fat sack of shit. Quit acting like surviving schoolyard bullying is equivalent to surviving combat, ok? She's trying to say that her eating disorder makes it impossible for her to be anywhere inbetween morbidly obese and skeletal. Really? I mean perhaps she can't afford treatment. I don't know. This just seems like a lot of excuses to me.
Hmmmm I don't think there is anything shittier than an entitled fuck who thinks it's okay to belittle the people who are serving you.
alimony would go both ways if men got equal treatment in courts, but as a guy, good fucking luck convincing a judge that you deserve some of your ex wife's money. I know it happens but it's rare as fuck.
OH MY GOD WHY. WHY WOULD YOU KEEP EATING WHEN YOU GET TO THAT POINT!?!? This "dude" is literally carrying around a fucking spoon for the sake of wiping his own ass. WHY THE FUCK would you keep eating at that point. I think once someone is THAT far gone, suicide is definitely a viable option.
I knew a ham who used to claim his fat-related groin chafing was "jock itch," as if anyone believed he had been participating in a sport.

How delusional does someone have to be to think that they can put 0 effort into being healthy and still be a target of attraction for people who invest a lot of time and discipline into staying healthy?Ridiculous.

Why doesn't she actually lose the weight instead of trying to hide it with a corset?
I agree heavily with you, I am 14 and I eat as much as most adult men do, but I have more muscle and less fat than 90% of people my age. The difference? My parents taught me to eat what I need if I don't have practice, and eat what I want as long as I work out to help burn it off if I do. I was at an all you can eat the other day, had 2 plates of Chinese Chicken Salad, and 2 steaks. What did the couple next to us shove down their kid's throat? Deep fried chicken, french fry's, ice cream, cookies, pie, soda, what ever they could. But wait, that's not the worst part, the kid was in a fucking booster seat..... Seriously, what the flying fuck?
That's like three gallons. I would think that's doable, but I'm not sure.
Improvements in the healthcare system? Improve your diet, you fat, murderous fuck!
Had this moment a few weeks ago. If you're ever in OKC go to the top of the Chase tower. At the top there is a bar and an event room. Next to this is a bathroom. I walk in looking to pee in a urinal like any other man. As I walk in there is a sheet of 12 foot opaque glass in front of a massive window overlooking the city. I walk past it and a waterfall begins running to the entirety of the glass. I look around, there are no urnials. I look down and realize at the base of the glass is a collection of river stones over top what appears to be a drainage. In that moment I realize I am supposed to piss in this. This is my urinal. Alone and unafraid, 350 feet in the air, I looked out over the city I love and relieved myself into a waterfall.

Hell, anyone nowadays who can finish a marathon in 12 hours and do half-assed yoga because there's too much fat in the way to do full-effort yoga is an olympic athlete.
Lol "what men want"? How about reference what the majority of porn actresses look like? Do they pull this "what men want" bullshit out of their lard rolls or something? Even the low self-esteem guys, even the neckbeards, don't go searching for boner-terrorist hams when they're picking their next porn video. The guys who truly like hams have mental issues and need psychological help.
The uploader of the video source for that gif, taofledermaus, is exceptionally careful with the mercury he experiments with. It's not especially dangerous but it is a hazard and more importantly it's very expensive! Losing any is a hit to the wallet.
5'9 isn't short...it's average...Right? Guys? I'm not short, right?
yeah, ban me too pls..

Loved Lee's posts all the way from FPS to FatLogic to here. She verified me not long ago. Thought she was on vacation with the lack of posting.You will be missed. :(
Oh, they know. The know everything you've mentioned. It is just like in that Beatles' song: "Living is easy with eyes closed". Fatties simply close their eyes when counting calories and food intake.
Then wrap it in bacon and deep fry it
I'm not familiar with women's sizes, what is 16?
I'm afraid this person is very young. How do people let themselves go at such a young age.
Xray or it didn't happen.
Exactly.
I think I'm going to be sick. Healthy at every size? Blood is not supposed to look like that.
No, aren't there 2 disneyland in America?
oh yeah, my boyfriend's mother is so insistent on trying to feed me things I can't eat. both my boyfriend and I have allergies/digestive problems and she bought us a ton of stuff that we can't eat. I ended up giving it all to my own mother and she didn't have to buy groceries for two weeks.my boyfriend and his brother both have what's probably crohn's disease since they were kids and they're only doing better now because of suggestions I've made, instead of just eating whatever their mother gets. thanksgiving is going to be hell if we have to go over there.
Wow, that is just awful.
Yes.
That's one way to lose weight.
You complain about free speech but then you censor yourself
Ironically I couldn't hear that over the sound of her gaining weight.
Deluded. That is all.
Fire drills at the firm I used to work at drove this point home. After the first one, I made sure to be one of the first people in the stairwell every time. I'd even run down the stairs (we were on the 7th floor) so as to beat the hams on floors 2 and 3 who would block everyone from exiting the building when they got into the stairwell.
This is the third time in two days that I've run across the number 1200. It seems to be a thing w fatlords. They somehow ALL eat 1200 cal. Except thats a deficit. And there is NO WAY you are eating 1200 and not losing. WTF where did this number come from? It's obviously bullshit.
Wtf? five foot ten and 125 is not overweight?
As a Wal-Mart employee I see shit like this all the time. Hamplanets that "need" these scooters, riding around and running people over (yes I've seen them literally run into carts and people one even knocked over a display of movies). So I usually ignore them when they come up to me in electronics or I just shake my head and make eye contact.But I get a real kick out of when they go in reverse cause the chair beeps and all I can think is "WIDE LOAD COMING THROUGH!!!!"It's the little things in life.Or not so little.
&gt; Now there's all those articles trending on Facebook about "real moms" that are fat and stretch marked up and everyone is just cooing over how "beautiful" it all is.Really? That's absolutely disgusting.

Are we talking about smoking or eating?
Judging by the neck hair alone, my guess is this is a woman. :-)
That's true, though the ham nerds seem to be a growing thing. I go to a con once a year and there seems to be a fair mix.I went to PAX last year and I was surprised that shirts went up to 3XL. I bought a shirt and it was pretty generous with the sizing.
It's a sad say when you have to worry about your stomach peeking out the bottom of your shorts
Next time you should reply "I'm pretty sure men like any women, except fat ones". And if they start flipping out "I'm sorry, but what's your BMI?"
The only thing she's qualified to cosplay is the Space Battleship Yamato.
That's definitely a great tongue twister.
I guess she's so big that's the only position her legs can be in...
I was thinking just that! There are only a handful of women that I feel like have earned the name "supermodel," and most of them are rolling in riches and have had a career for years! She's just a "model" for a single brand.
I only read the first sentence and I have this to say: Read the rules before you post. Nobody wants to read nonsensical ramblings anyway.

Top left one is a "professional pin-up model" according to her profile.
Wow. She really thought that people would want someone who says they hate kids looking after their kids? The fat is affecting her brain.

This is incredibly insightful, specifically for people that don't have the perspective of a black male chubby chaser. He really pointed out the deep emotional flaws/insecurities that a guy would have to have to be satisfied with a gross woman.So many excellent quotes."A raggedy female is a result of a raggedy dude.""She's five ham sandwiches past thick."
So wait, do they not know they're fat? Or do they think other people can't see them?
None of their ass would FIT on that poor chair
You can see in their eyes how they're dying inside.
And now thats she's married she can REALLY let herself go.
Looks like Jonah hill.
&gt;A recent publication out of the UT Health Center tracked participants over a 10 year period and found that drinking diet soda nearly doubles your waist circumferenceUh... While the study does indeed correlate an increase in waist circumference with both regular and occasional consumption of diet soda, it definitely doesn't DOUBLE IT.Directly from the abstract:&gt;*This translates to ΔWCs of 0.80 inches for nonusers, 1.83 inches for occasional users, and 3.16 for daily users over the total SALSA follow-up*So unless someone's waist circumference started at 3.16 inches, there was no doubling going on.Also, I laughed that the study abbreviates to "SALSA".

:-O every day I learn about another awesome sub. thanks homey
I have an acquaintance who's enormously fat. I've known her for something like 4 years. despite the fact she has a successful career, is not overly annoying and makes good money, she didn't land a single date in those 4 years, while I did several times.but it's not because she's fat, after all 90% of men like BBW. it's because of... uh... of...I dunno man. I can't even formulate something witty to go against this fatlogic.
Silly shitlord, density is a construct of the patriarchy.
They're reserved for fatties and some woman who have had children. But no decent child has stretch marks.
I was thinking lawyer too. It doesn't sound like he is targeting a group of people that are actually protected in any legal way. In fact it read like he was giving science based information in an effort to help others people and had a lot of support from the medical community.

I disagree. The comeback for the "it's expensive to eat well" bullshit is, "it doesn't cost anything to put down the fork."You can lose weight eating McDonald's and ice cream as long as you run a calorie deficit. Sure, it's better to cook well at home, but it's all about the calories. If the fat fucks limited themselves to 1,500 calories of fast food a day, the weight would come off. I know because I did it myself. I dropped 110 lbs. while working a job that kept me 70-100+ hours a week. I got some exercise by walking around the office and taking the stairs, but what really did it was choking off the calories. With those hours, all the decent restaurants were closed. There was no time to shop or cook.So, some nights, I went to the 24 hour McDonald's. Two McDoubles and a water are around 900 calories. That would be all I'd have that day. And sometimes I fasted because I wanted the fucking fat off me. It worked.
Unfortunately, I have to confirm it is a male or at least it was on the males section of Tinder. The sight of it was very triggering to me and I am still recovering from it.
There needs to be a rule about fat chicks wearing sleeves. Seriously, if all your friends are whales, why the fuck would you have them sleeveless and in short dresses ruining your photos?
It's a damn shame the episodes never show the shit she stuffs into that black hole of hers.
Just making sure you're not being a hypocrite.
This triggered my fatphobia.
I too love food. But I still have self control.
Eeeeeewwwww..... I really wish I hadn't seen this.
She wants a REAL man.
This is a big one at my office. The thing is, they could still watch 6 hours of TV over the weekend, and spend 2 of those hours exercising. When I get home from my nightly 5 miler, I paint my nails and watch TV. I almost always have dessert after dinner. Etc.It's not that hard...?
'Cute', as a word, has been stolen from us. 'Cute' should mean puppies, small hamsters, your darling future shitlord niece or nephew... These fat assholes have hijacked it... They are not cute. They are delusional.
Re: 2That's... Not how it works. The connective tissues can and do thin, which causes the separation between the abdominal muscles, but that can happen with any rapid weight gain or severe strain on the abdominal muscles. Even some very buff guys develop abdominal separation.It's also a LOT less likely to happen in younger women who haven't been pregnant before.Add in the fact that not all full term healthy babies weigh 9-10 lbs (I weighed 7 lbs at birth, my niece weighed 6), and it's entirely possible for a fit, young, first time mother to not look like a balloon.(Oh, it's actually more likely the less visibly pregnant woman is more uncomfortable. The uterus has to go somewhere when it expands, and if it's not going out... Then I bet her bladder, stomach, intestines, and diaphragm are feeling the crunch.)Oh, you can totally have abs with a separation. It goes down the center line of the body. Depending on how big the gap is, you might need medical advice for safe abdominal exercises, but having separation is not the end of washboard abs. Actually, the real reason you probably see fit women with 4 kids and no ab definition is because they have loose skin from that many pregnancies, or they have other priorities than maintaining a low enough body fat percentage for abs to be visible.
I work with a fat person who constantly fat shames but doesn't seem to realise that she is just as fat (fatter in some cases) than the people she's shaming.
Does she even know what muscle looks like? I am speechless.
Oh I know! The end was baffling! "It all comes back to metabolism." Ugh, face palm.
Two hammies at it, I can only imagine the feast they will have after.
Is that a thing when your too fat?
"Research has shown" bullshit. Show me a source in APA format. Lazy fucks mention research but can't be bothered to actually research
Dammit lol
You know what's more unfair than being fat? Being born into a family with a history of mental illness.
I think grade 1 for females should be 30-35%. 25-30% is still in pretty good shape for women, not as much for men. Most "normal" adult women fall in this range, so it doesn't seem right to start the fat train there.
&gt;Do I make myself clear?LOL. This stupid bucktooth fatshit. It belongs in a mental asylum. In a dark room by itself forever.
You're right, it's not complicated to be healthy. I'm trying to hit specific goals (show abs), so that level of detail is required for tracking what you eat since a lot of food offered can be misleading about what is actually in it.A macro split (macro as in macronutrients) is a ratio of how many protein / fat / carb grams you're eating. (P/F/C). This isn't a fad method as all as any diet, named or not, can be quantified using this method. So for a fat loss diet, your split would be something like 45/25/30. So, 45% of your calories would come from protein sources, etc. From there, you'd divide that number by 4 to get actual grams of protein you'd need. (1800 cal x .45)/4=202.5g of protein per day.
I think he looks more like Dilbert's pointy haired boss.
Food generally plays a large part in the community. That food is typically fried, uses butter in excess, sugary drinks. Basically it is like amped up southern culture mixed with poverty.That being said, all my black friends are in phenomenal shape, women included. I think maybe 2 or 3 are fat, but they know why.

Lost 15 pounds in one week after I got my wisdom teeth taken out. Can vouch for this.
Let's say that your energy requirements are 1,100kcal and not 1,500, but you are consuming 1,500 per day. This would amount to a 1lb weight gain every 8-9 days.The key to making a diet work for you is to adjust it according to the results you get vs the goals you want to achieve... If you stick with a diet strictly and honestly for several weeks and you gain a lb or two, then you adjust your calories down. Also 100 kcal per day for an entire year would be more like a 10lb gain.Genuinely asking questions is never stupid.
I think (hope) that the government is going to have to step up. If hams just started dropping like flies then great. That may even solve the social security problem. The fact is that obesity simply costs too much. Unless large pharmaceutical companies and shit food manufacturers (people who actually benefit form the obesity) manage to keep the government from promoting healthy lifestyle. I really don't see the fats waking up one day and having a change of their enlarged heart and having an oatmeal for breakfast.

An apple vs 40g of sugar from HFCS or refined sugars are not one in the same. The research is contradictory, but current consensus seems to be that large amount of glucose (&gt;100 at a meal, which likely this meal approaches) can cause leaning and behavior difficulty in a subset of 'sensitive' children.
Listen, and understand. The Buffet Terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel shame, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop eating, ever, until it or the buffet is dead.

Because the fucking firing solution was off. See that fine spray of mist in the background? That was supposed to be them.
Oh man, everything about this is so "American" (I'm not, so this is just the stereotype we're confronted with daily) it hurts.
I think you hit it on the head with drug addiction, because that's essentially what it is. For them, there is this magical answer to any problem they may face, and all they have to do to make bad feelings go away is to stuff their face with food.I'm a firm believer in modeled behavior, which is why I try to always be aware of what I'm doing when my little girl is watching. For a kid who grows up seeing a parent constantly eating, or using food as a reward for good behavior, or a solution for bad behavior, the end result is invariably going to be a fatass.Add brain-altering chemicals present in shitty food and high sugar content and you have a little addict running around filling their body with substances that probably cause some psychological problems.
that is not a shirt, that is a towel
She said she's in good shape. Now I don't identify as a feminist one bit because I think it's gone completely bizarre and there are way too many man haters in it for me to cosign, but the ones here seem to not have any screws loose.There was a great post about FA and feminism a couple days ago that addressed the issue. Something about "beef with a side of fries" if you want to search for it. I can't link it because I'm on my phone.
&gt;... a person's predisposition to obesity, and also where fat is stored on the body.You know FA types are going to ignore the predisposition part of this and only pay attention to the title.
I'm pretty sure this is dated.93% Lean ground beef around here costs $6 per lb, not $4.

I shared a single home with 8 people. Although 4 of them were not fat but filthy we didn't have much problems with them. There were 2 fatties and they would use the whole fucking fridge for themselves (imagine a single fridge for 9 people) the kitchen was always greasy and smelled disgusting so it was uncomfortable to even eat in the house. They used to steal weed from the other guys (they even got inside their rooms for it). The worst thing was the bathroom. The fatty female would take long showers and again, imagine a single bathroom for 9.**do not do it**
That was over 3 years. The pictures are one year apart.Still 87kg is very heavy for a woman.
Once she goes thick, she gets no dick....
And then some rapid steps forward followed by a spartan kick.
Oh look, this post again.
&gt;I'm secure about women since I'm, y'know, a woman.&gt;So, just because I'm not a feminist, you think that I'm threatened by it? I got this from you saying &gt;And I don't know what being a woman has to do with it, women are some of the most rabidly upset and irrationally threatened by the word feminism that I have seen.and&gt;Are people really that insecure about women? (while referring to me)It's really not that hard to understand. You said that I'm insecure about women even though I'm a woman after I mentioned how I dislike when people force the "feminist" label on me. You're saying that I can't logically disagree with feminism and it *must* come from some deep insecurities which is *irnoically* sexist. Also you both said &gt;If this sub makes a woman feel safe or empowered or encourages them to be healthier, then call it feminist.and &gt;nobody is forcing anything on youwhich are contradictions... You *are* forcing the feminist label on me, by calling the sub I spend the most time on "feminist".I hope that you re-read this whole discussion and maybe learn something. I am done talking about this with you, I'm not getting anything out of it. Have a good day.

You don't need it. Your vagina is self-cleaning and maintains a certain PH and when you mess with that with douching or "feminine wash/deodorant" that's when you can get things like thrush. All you need is water and maybe a mild soap for your vulva/labia.
Where that picture of that beetus leg from yesterday? Someone should slap that on there.
LOLAt first I thought that pillow was her gut.
There was a post awhile ago where a someone posted pics of themselves in size 00 clothes with room to spare and a comparison of what an actual 00 should look like. It was to show the extent of vanity sizing in affecting small clothing. I posted a similar pic in that thread to show that my body certainly should not be a size 0, but it is. Op doesn't like these posts and posts illustrating the growing world around us. She only wants fat people. Fat people mess everything up and I support the big picture.

You should look into tailoring! I have fairly large arms, I love to wear slim-fitting clothes, and I don't have a ton of money, but my choices are Uniqlo (arms way to small, everything else fits fine), J. Crew (fits pretty well but super expensive), Banana Republic (stack coupon deals to get stuff at a good price but I don't like a lot of their patterns), and JC Penney used to have a good line called JCP but they got rid of it when a ton of hams and middle-aged women complained.My solution is going to Macy's and buying Alfani or something for $10 on sale, then bringing it to a tailor for another $15 to end up with a $25 shirt that fits great.

**Can bmi be misleading?** I know in general, bmi can be a good way to determine if a person is fat or not... But can't it sometimes be misleading? Especially when the person has a high bmi, but works out often? Asked by /u/slimandnotshady---The BMI is a scale that applies to the general population (as with anything applied to humans, there will be outliers that are not adequately covered by this scale). It's purpose is to assess risk for diseases for which obesity is a factor. The BMI scale varies depending on your ethnicity. [The WHO](URLThe BMI can be misleading if you are an outlier. That means if you are someone with less body fat but more muscle mass, you can end up weighing a considerable amount. Competitive bodybuilder Lee Priest has a competition BMI of 33.6 to 35.2 [and this is what he looks like](URLWhy not just do that for the entire population? The BMI is a quicker calculation as it only requires one's height and weight, and most people know those off-hand. Body fat percentage must be tracked in a different way.
I was about to ask if you spoke from experience. I hope you did not.
Prader-Willi, also. It can lead to continual, uncontrollable feelings of intense hunger.
That's really the way to look at it. You look the way you work to look-alike unlike these hams. No its not easy. But damn- running 26 miles? That's a fucking accomplishment for anyone. I hope to be able to run 5 someday without having to rest.
Fats using their stomachs as table alternatives piss me off so much. There's not even a fucking fork on the damn plate. He either uses his hands or just his face like a dog. Why do hams have to be slobs as well?

Fat women. Whether it's just getting laid, trying to start or trying to maintain a relationship, 90% of the time there's a fat jealous cunt to circumvent to get laid, start the relationship, or tolerate once in a relationship. Even the best of women seem to have a fatty or two in their group of friends, because if they didn't, they'd have no female friends since that's damn near all there is anymore among either gender.Think about it. They outnumber us 2 to 1. Unless you've gone full shitlord, you probably won't cut a friend off for turning into a ham.

People like to block out the unhealthy food they eat and over-exaggerate the healthy food they eat. They think they are following a diet similar to this when they are really eating twice as much as they should.

Her profile picture (in upper left corner) is of a hot girl. All of her pictures in her profile are Of her... who is not the girl in her profile picture. This is instagram, where people can except follow requests that will let people see their photos.
I've always wondered this but have never said it out loud because of the barrage of tumblrage that I knew would be following it. I also notice a lot of the people on tinder that put "not here for hookups" are gross fat chicks anyways...
Relevant gif is relevant.

My mom was in nursing school when I was little, so I have had a fascination with the human body from an early age. Seeing that kind of stuff is cool to me.
I have a 950 lb horse. They weigh more then him. That's incredible.
I'm just gonna go ahead and assume fat girls don't shave/trim it. Ugh. So that stench you hate is aided by 8 years worth of bush growth.

You don't eat random 4 000 calories a day in processed crap and enjoy the taste. The two are not linked.
I was wondering if that's what she meant but that is so incredibly low, like normal is 96% can you even be alive in teens, isn't that just like death?
But when I joined his Facebook page, I noticed all he does nowadays is ask for donations.

This is a good theory. I also think it has to do with them feeling like they should support them because they secretly think the fatties should be encouraged to stay that way because it means they will never be more attractive than the skinny people. Therefore, less competition.
I kind of figured it might be controversial. But I saw the post you were talking about (among others), so I thought it could be okay. I don't have too much of a problem with the downvoting of the post. That's the point of downvoting, as you said. If people don't like it, they can say so by doing that. The comment downvoting and whining is a bit annoying, but Reddit is Reddit, even on an awesome sub like this.At least I've gotten a reaction out of people. I know many people are either offended or aroused (or both) when they see images of women in less clothes than they'd usually wear. That 'offended' feeling really does seem to only come to people when they're reacting to women. Because women in underwear only belong in gonewild subs. Outside of that, it's "improper". Sorry for pulling the feminist card, but you had a great point.
No need to insult fishes.
The guitar, much like her life, is painfully out of tune.
If she can bench 175 then I'm a fucking raccoon.
She does look like she's fatter than average- the photo i nthe article is her.
You're probably fine. They don't demand that you be a fitness model, just that you be not overweight. No matter how critical you might be of your body otherwise, fat is fat and not fat is not fat. That's quite a bit of wiggle room. :)5'2" and 110lbs is a BMI closer to 20 btw...
Good, the last thing we need is young fat people.Shitlord away my son.
It meets all the signs of compulsive pleasure seeking behavior. Addiction is physiological dependence on a substance. Drug addicts experience withdrawal symptoms that range from terribly unpleasant to life threatening. This guy isn't coming down from a high or going through a withdrawal he just revels in the pleasure of stuffing his fat face. Stop calling them addicts and making it seem like it's a clinical problem or beyond their control.
Da fun this bitch be complaining about.She is on fat slice of crazy bitch.
I think it's hilarious because it looks like his head is sitting on a bed or something. The beard + pale fat makes it look like his head isn't connected to a body, just sort of sitting out there.
TAKE BETTER CARE OF IT THEN. Geez. Stop overstuffing it. &amp; when you have cuntdishunz from all that access weight, your body is basically about to break up with you. So if you don't want to leave this body that you LUUUUURRRRRVE so much, stop being a delusional slob.
How about you stop being such a fucking faggot?

:'( I was on a medication called prednisone for a long time to help a disease I have. In addition to making my appetite go up like crazy (I did gain some weight, but it's gone now) one of the side effects is a condition called "moon face" So I'm not a fatty but I look like one in the face because of that stupid medicine and I hate it so, so much. It bothers me everyday. No matter what I do I'll never have a normal face again.I'm gonna go cry about it again :(

This is why we need euthanasia.
I have this issue quite often at my job. They get so pissed when you have to stick them more than once but they never understand that its their weight that is causing the problem. I do xrays on morbidly obese people as well and that is a living hell.. we have had to send patients to the zoo for xrays. The fucking ZOO.
shameless /r/smokerhate plug
Hatesturbating so hard right now
You should let them know about Planet Fitness...perhaps they'll fit in better there?
&gt; I got no idea about the MexicansMexico beat the US for obesity.
Can we objectively say she's even living?
Yeah fatties tend to feel shamed into getting salads around slim people. Funny how shaming makes them choose healthy options.
Don't do that. You may strain your back trying to push that much
RIP, Lee. I haven't been around long but I've always appreciated your posts.
Agh, the majestic Basement-Dwelling Butter Troll ( *lardius virginicus* ). During mating season, it dawns a garish, multi-colored plumage to distract prospective mates from the horrible sweaty folds behind it. Despite this, no known instances of it ever working have ever been observed in the wild.
And she can't fucking act for shit. Her lines are just sort of garbled out while her arms are sticking out at a strange angle because she can't lower them all the way down because of her side stomach fat.
Make up is photoshop for real life, been that way for years.
Thank you for your service shitlord officer.
Disney run, man. Once you get up to the Boardwalk or Hollywood Studios, it doesn't matter what your pace is.I did the same thing, but ran a 2 :00: 08 in the half, but then did the full with my mom to get her through. And even then, my ~60 year old mother beat this obeasts time by over an hour. And my mother has had major knee replacement surgery. That's sad as hell.
I think he means gassy, not classy.
How do you know she's stalking you?
Brilliant motivation for working out. Watching all the hambeasts wobble into McDonalds will just make everyone work that little bit harder in the gym!
You'd need Bruce Willis' skills at mining to pop that cherry.
where i live, they dont hire people over a specific bmi( i dont know i think its 30) if they want to become officials( i hope its the right word).
I'd say most health conscious grocery stores have like zero fatties. But the place to go when you want to be left alone from them is outdoors on hiking trails. I go hiking every week and have maybe seen one fatty before in the last six months. It was a flat trail though, that's why.
Begone, Flubber
I just see so many people living their lives bereft of logic and it makes me angry.
Lol! I'm sure that was the sentiment. It's just a strange thing to say someone. Apparently basic social skills are running low in supply.
Is that Eric Cartman?
Man I hate this fat cunt.
Better yet, send them a donut box filled with veggies. It'll be a gr8 b8 m8.
They raged at you for skipping breakfast? Wtf? Skipping breakfast is healthy, unless the idiot that raged at you thinks shoving a bowl of cereal (sugar and calorie packed corn mush) with milk into your mouth is healthier that burning your own body fat for energy.
An I the only one who still doesn't get it?
Ya in all honesty that is probably the greatest move those people will make in their lives. CO is the greatest state in the US. Best combination of skiing, climbing, hiking, camping, biking than any other state out there(except maybe utah), and no fatties!
If you wore those it would be oppressive to more *full sized* proportion food clothing, how dare you
WHo the fuck would go up to another group of people at a club waiting for drinks and join them in their arm wrestling. What the fuck?!?!? Especially a fatty! No self awareness of their grossness. The only fairness I'll give him is my palms get clammy befor ei play basketball or am about to compete, yo. I just envision instead of a bit of sexy shitlord blood sweat and tears of awesomeness, youg ot a sloppy gross and smelly greasy palm slap.
Should I start an automated fatty washer? The demographics are supporting the business model.
Omg. That moronic sack of fatfuck don't know how arm rests work? Hope he gets stuck
What a catch.
this Michael Moore rhetoric I can't even
She just said that to make people feel extra bad
Oh hey, another hairy dairy cow! They're not doing themselves any more favors. "Hey, I'm a bucket of lard who wrestled in a tar pit with a sasquatch! OBEY MAH CURVES!" I want to rip her arm off and slap her with it.
And a bonus ham arm in the background.
You know they need mod approval. Falls on fat ears.
"Heavyset" and "stocky" are real body types. That's just fat.
My mother was in a miserable condition with stage 4 lymphoma and she had perfect bloodwork. She died about a week after the last blood test which was good as well. I wouldn't say she was very healthy at the time.
Im not a huge fan of 6 pack on women, but damn I love "the line". Tone enough, but not too much. Fuckin beautiful!
Just like her mother... Eurgh..
This sort of shit is what really rustles my jimmies. You literally reinvent your way of thinking, the way you eat, the way you go about your daily life by adding a couple hours of physical activity, just to see a little bit of change in your body every couple of weeks, AND THIS LAZY FAT SHIT THINKS SHE DESERVES SOMEONE WITH THAT MUCH FUCKING DISCIPLINE?! I hope she looses a fucking leg to the beetus. Im so fucking pissed right now. This is why I cant come to this sub so often. It really burns.Edit: Anyone ever get so pissed typing they just miss words?
I don't even want to look at it.
Is that a human body, or did a rack of canned biscuits bust open and merge like fucking Devastator from Transfomers and get a Tumblr.

I don't really listen to Rush despite being conservative, I just like other talk radio hosts better. But back during the revolutionary war only 1/3 of the population actually fought for the revolution. So if you think of it like that then yes 1/3 of the population can do quite a lot. But on the bright side, if we do last a few more generations before our economy completely collapses then if there really is a lot of fat sympathy then from what I can see, most of the fatties will die off way before the actual healthy people do. There will just become less and less of them as they grow popular given the time.
I watched a documentary on something similar. Louis Theroux visited a few families in America with trans kids, I thought some of the parents were pretty supportive.
RoboCop mod.
yes exactly.
Wait, isn't this the fedora tipping guy? Hard to tell, they all look equally shit.
Kayaking for hours and hours at a time in the ocean, bc, thin privilege (after my usual morning workout). I will not be exhausted afterwards.

Haha, yea, I kinda half-assed that response, I meant to go on and say "If he won't lower his standards to get some strange, why would anyone else".I mean, if you have a fetish you can't help it, I may not understand it, and find it disgusting, but who am I to judge you based on who you like to fuck(Though I will judge who you like to fuck)?

You can almost see the smugness/arrogance/pretentiousness on him, too.
Nice. You're killing today friend!
so does she...her first boyfriend was actually decent-looking, but these two together look like an old married couple who gave up. disgusting.
Off topic, but I love your username/flair combo!
I saw the run time of more than 10 minutes but clicked anyway. I stayed until the very end.That was beautiful.
They would call her a slut. Only fat women are allowed to expose their body. But then again, no one thinks of sex when looking at a lardass.
And yet, the fatties keep saying that they don't over eat.
At that point, they are no longer breasts. They're tumors.
Thin privilege is being able to drown.
cool story fatty
What? He's hot. Too bad something's blocking the view.
17 days? Holy shit, not bad. There's been people around here that have gotten lost on popular, easy trails and only lasted for a few days in the week. Some people just have horrible path finding skills.Looks like she had a terrible time though. Clothing, shelter, water, a little food is all you need to find yourself back to civilization. Once got lost in the Tuolumne wilderness and came out in a couple of days in better spirits than the first night getting lost. You haven't lived until you've felt the relief of seeing some park ranger trucks for the first time in 72 hours.Always prepare to be lost in the woods multiple days when you're going out. Nature isn't Disneyland.How much you want to bet she goes right back to gorging on food because she has been through a, "*traumatic experience*?"
At most places, they aren't allowed to serve walking customers in the drive thru. ...hmm maybe the beetus is affecting her vision and she had to get out for a closer look
Pretty sure FB positivity comments are a back scratching thing...."I'll ignore reality and tell you what you want to hear and in turn, you do same for me when I burden society with my own 'shouldnt be seen in light of day' photos."
A meme is a repeated idea.
I actually went and looked up what people were eating to hit 10K and I immediately take back what i said about being able to do it. I felt physically ill reading the list.
This is an insult to the majesty of actual whales.
Where are her poor kneecaps.
Gramma, no!
She does not look happy.
/s ?
I know this isn't attractive, having all that extra skin. But holy shit, she had to be huge to accumulate that much excess, which makes it all the more impressive that she lost that much. I'm glad to see people take control of their lives and bodies like this lady did.
It stands for Schutzstaffel.
Yeah man I've eaten at his house and man oh man was it delicious but so bad for you, butter in nearly everything, sugar, the whole shebang.

Right?! Did she honestly think she could support 300+lbs with her arms?! I don't even think I could do that with an extra 160lbs strapped to my body.
Who the fuck gets a tattoo of a spoon.
I'm never surprised how often "shitlording" is just an application of basic common sense to any given fat situation (fatuation?). All you have to do is give the obvious answer and watch them squirm and squeal while blubbering excuses.
So, hypothetically, if you put the hard work behind it, you could acheive an eqivalent body shape of this:URLHow long do you think it would take you?
Has sex in her boyfriend's family's living room, hates "slutty girls"...
My b!tch with minimal fat is hotter than you will ever be.
Male or female? I honest to god can't tell.
So long as you don't do any damage there's nothing wrong with it. If the kids old enough, they should understand that life can be painful - not slapping them makes them think otherwise. My parents hit me growing up, they never harmed me, but I felt some "sting" sometimes. In no way do I resent my parents, nor did it cause any emotional damage. The only thing abusive here is not preparing your kids for the real world, by failing to discipline them.
I always do. Guess this is the price a sub pays for becoming this big.
Wow, that's incredible!
You're not trying to lose weight u dumbass. Quit defending the fatties. Edit: Mcdonalds is not good to eat. I never eat it. Not sure why i'm being downvoted for this.
Oh come on, Catherine used a set of pulleys to get a horse to fuck her. Some engineer out there could make some real money building her a contraption of some kind.
I always make my "I smell shit" face when I see her.

Well, speaking out against Jewish scum might not be the smartest thing to do, considering that you could have your door smashed down, be handcuffed and sent to prison for this sort of thing in most Western countries at present. But at least I am telling the TRUTH.
Shut the fuck up, you are part of the problem.
English motherfucker?
Goddamn fatties. We went on holiday last year for a month, during that time we had a family friend (fatty) take care of the house and our dog. We get home to find she had gained a ridiculous amount of weight, had a bad flea problem and was quite sick.
That show gives me an aneurysm trying to figure out how you can keep gaining weight when you weight 700lbs and have a stomach the size of a thumb. I can't even wrap my mind behind the science of that...
Wow. Fucking rude.
3 has no chance in hell. Not only is she a ball of goo but she is bloody ugly.
Facebook.Not Snoutbook.
Ive noticed whenever there is a fruit and veggie tray, the fatties sometimes eat a couple pieces of broccoli (drenched in dressing of course) or some grapes and it's like "oh I ate healthy now I can have 6 pieces of cake", as tho the small serving of veggies cancels out the 57 grams of fat, 7000 calories worth of cake they ate right after
Thin privilege is being a healthy and desirable meal for a cannibal.
Is that really considered a shirt at that point?
right, I was just verifying my experience with other women here, thank you...
I liked the one where he wanted to gain a bunch of weight to collect unemployment and everybody hated him
Goddamn I love poutine.Once a month or less, though.
Least he didn't try to take anyone with him.
When you put it like that, I could only think, "oh God, I've got 3 whole months of DOMS in my legs like I've had for the last week after every day I've worked out?" (clarifying for those that don't know me, I'm a normal weight, I'm just not fit, not since I was 21, and I'm trying to get back to it)Fuck it, I'm still working out and I'm not stopping, even if I feel like curling into the fetal position and sucking my thumb at the moment.
Fat people are fat.
Can you imagine what they would look like without Photoshop? I'm scared to know.
Like a human KFC DoubleDown.
Last time this question came up, another shitlord (forget who) suggested that her maw hangs open in preparation for the next offering

If you don't care about beauty standards, why are you trying to create a false waist by putting your hands on your stomach? That's a model trick, sweetie, made to make you look thinner. Almost as if thinner is better. Hmmmm...
In the defac... shocking!
Join some sort of a fitness/sports related team. I've been on my collegiate rowing team for years now and only just found out this past weekend that a hell of a lot of them browse FPH. Drop some subtle hints and usually people will chirp up (I used the terms shitlord and ham planet after one of the guys started talking about "skinny shaming" and everyone was immediately like "YOU GUYS ARE ON FPH TOO?" It was great).

Million dollar idea! Bedazzled wipin' sticks. Those quirky lumbarinas would eat it up. Oh, hopefully not litterally.
I think that if you watch the movie carefully rather than just listening to what they say, you can see how it actually is the fault of the kids or their parents.
you spelled eating wrong
Here's my diet:Meatpoultryfisheggscheesevegetablesblack coffeeAvoid carbs and sugar like the plague.I bet I eat steak 3-4 times a week and I'm no where near that lard barge. You can eat like a king as long as you're not eating like a peasant at the same time. I bet that dude has never even seen the inside of a gym let alone know what goes on in one.
She looks really good. They would give their soul to look like her. I am so tired of people heaping praise onto fat asses like Adele, Meagan Trainor, etc for embracing mediocrity and women like Sara Sampaio are being told that they are bad role models for young girls because they are no where close to being obese and that they are fit and exercise. It's like I'm living in backwards land.

Willpower. Plus they figure they're an appetite suppressant so they can eat more now!
She looks fantastic. OP is a fattie, confirmed.
It just shows that this is all genetic.
Ugh so so so so SOOOOOOOOO much wrong with that article.That study she cited "proving" that diets don't improve health markers does not prove anything of the kind. It shows that health markers such as blood pressure DID improve in the diet group, just not as much as if they were given medication. It also stated that while fasting glucose was not significantly decreased due to weight loss, THE INCIDENCE OF DIABETES WAS. The only marker that didn't actually change in the diet was high cholesterol/high lipid levels. However, the average weight loss in the diet group was only .94kg or just over 2 lbs. I didn't see any information on what peoples' starting weights were (I suspect high if they were participating in a diet study) but of course the health markers aren't going to show huge improvements if people are going from obese, to 2 lbs lighter but still obese. Basically the author, a fat slacktivist completely misrepresented the information that was actually in the study she cited. I'm shocked.The other study she cites (by Flegal) is likewise misrepresented. She doesn't even link to Flegal's study in the article because again, the data doesn't support what she's claiming. She thinks the people who attacked it, like Willett, are just shills for the diet industry and are attacking it for ideological rather than scientific reasons. However, the reason that Willlett called Flegal's study rubbish, is because she didn't control for people who've never smoked. Smokers tend to be more likely to remain in the normal BMI range but still have a ton of adverse health outcomes due to the smoking. Given that that's the case, of course it's going to skew the data towards the overweight/obese range. Even with that skewing however, Flegal's study shows that for anyone under the age of 60, a normal BMI is still the healthiest. At 60, being RIGHT on the borderline of normal/overweight has the best health outcomes, it doesn't start shifting towards the middle of overweight until people are 70+. There are a number of confounding factors that Fleagal doesn't account for given that she's really talking about the overweight range being healthiest for late middle aged/elderly people. When you get to that age, being thin is often associated with either weight loss due to disease, or lack of muscle tone, since very few people in that age group maintain good levels of physical activity. I could go into even more breakdowns of why this article is rubbish, but I really don't feel like spending the time.TL;DR: Author misrepresents/misstates science to fit her ideological goals. Cites studies that don't actually say what she thinks they do. Typical whale song.
Even then. Just stop filling your fucking hole so much.
/r/eyebleach
In a short answer, the self esteem movement ruined generation Y and most millennials.Extended: It allowed the weakest and dumbest to feel great about themselves without actually achieving anything. Losers were encouraged to feel good about just being and not trying. Fatties were told they were only big boned and beautiful on the inside even though they continued to eat, and become, mounds of shit. Bullying was targeted by the white knights of society as epidemic 1, even though its completely useful in strengthening character and developing resilient, worthwhile people. But since people's precious fee-fees are more important than the very future of our species, losers go home with gold medals, androgynous pussified useless dipshits get laid, and neckbearded eat beasts are allowed to clear out entire buffets stations for 14.99.Good work, Society. I would have used a virus or a lab generated black hole to bring this shit to a grinding halt, but you opted for the slow death.
Onision gets a lot of shit because he's a drama whore but sometimes he absolutely nails it.
There was definitely some labored breathing.
Agreed, the mass starvation approach could be used a a marketing slight of hand but in reality they would never actually use the approach as it would damage short term profits. Even if they were able to get all the firms in the market to agree to this, starvation tactics would definitely get the attention of regulators and the government. The government may be their bitch but if it comes down to their entire approval rating versus just one or a small handful of their campaign contributors, as major as they may be, you can bet your ass our congress would turn on them.
At least you can stand. This planet would get winded after a few seconds.
Why the FUCK do fat people get disability?? This is not a disability its a fucking choice.
They should change it to bloated. I mean they should be able to leave it as fat but since even fa's know fat is bad and get their fee fees hurt then bloated would serve that purpose. Assuming that's not already an option Idk I don't use Facebook Edit: typing sideways on a phone cause I read this before bed is hard. Fixed ALL the words.
Imagine the smug look on her face as she typed that out, almost like "gotcha". Even a child could pick apart every point made. Clear to see how much she is disappointed in her own looks with all of this as well, she needs to believe in her arch rival "society" just to get up in the morning and face herself. What a waste of life to have fucked up your own body but the only way out you see is to try to fool society into thinking the mess you turned yourself into was a conscience choice, even if they hit the jackpot and that actually happened, they'd still die inside every time they faced a mirror!
"thrust"It's more like an ooze.
It looks like an avalanche of fat.
I think of that weirdly eloquent guy he played in Sin City.
A moderator on an internet forum is just an amalgamation of cells arranged in a homosapienesque manner that has a computer input device in front of it. Homosapienesque amalgamations of cells are known to hold individual ideals derived based on inputs provide during their environmental exposure up-to this point in time. If the sack of cells in question happens to have some form of power on an internet forum, it is free to apply its ideals to the governance of said forum until a more alpha cell-sack, or group of cell-sacks, overrides said ideals. Most importantly, homosapienesque amalgamations of cells cease to have ideals when the cell arrangement diverges from homosapeinism - such as when exposed to extreme trauma, or when liquefied in teleportation experiments.
Yeah, I've got a lot of petite friends who struggle finding clothes that fit them properly. I can imagine the struggle to be that much worse for you guys with all the shapes that come into account with ladies clothing.
They're fully aware of how disgusting they are; that's why they're so easy to piss off. Their strong, empowered shell exists under intense strain by a glue made of lies, deception, narcissism, and high fructose corn syrup. Beneath that shell is a bitter, self-absorbed little shit that's furious at the world for expecting something from them. Each little needle thrown, whether it be a legitimate insult or just walking around shirtless, causes explosive release of that anger inside.
ok im on an iPhone and it only gives us an option sometimes for some reason

After overlooking all the biases in that statement it's evident they're worshiping the student rather than the master.
I really want to see someone drag it around by its chin roll.
Depending on how tall that blonde girl is she could be considered curvy and not fat. Well, eh, I see two chins and the arms...she's really borderline here. I wish people like her would just pick a lifestyle.
She just went up a notch in my book for her honesty. Now she's at notch one.
I hate that parents allow their children to get fat. My boy is healthier than 95% of his friends and that's even with him being type 1 diabetic. He eats great, plays sports and does martial arts. My parents would have shamed me into losing weight had I gotten pudgy as a child and I would him. Luckily neither they nor I have/had to.

I saw the picture first and as I read the headline I'd thought she had been made to write those lines because she is fat. I glimpsed into a shitlord's paradise for just one second.
FFS, am I the only one creeped the fuck out at how TINY that woman's head is compared to her body?? It looks like if you put the Crypt Keeper's head on an obese person's body!
Brigading?
Nah. Her thighs definitely would be bigger than 24". I bet my head on it.
Roller derby, where tumblrinas tumble.
i think weed is an increasingly socially acceptable form of escapism for a lot of people, and i think the popularization of it as a 100% non-addictive miracle drug is bad. i think its healthier than alcohol, but i prefer a few beers to smoking weed because i can stay grounded in reality without the semi-dissociative effects of weed. its hard to act like myself while im high on weed, and i dont like that because i like being myself
no, it isn't. you are merely in denial or simply can't understand that even when you change your clothes and brush your teeth we can tell you're a smoker because we are non-smokers and we can smell what you can't because you've numbed down your sense of smell with all the cigarettes you've smoked. claiming smokers don't smell/claiming it's not obvious when someone is a smoker is like fat people claiming they are healthy. it's simply not true.
Fatties are their own gender. Forget X and Y, they have PB&amp;J chromosomes.
I haven't done it yet but I think I'll be not so subtle. Gonna get all crazy wide eyed and look like I've seen a ghost with my eyes darting back and forth from the weight limit sign to the various mounds and valleys. Then I'll lunge for the door right as its closing jamming my arm in and barely escaping with my life.That's if the fatty doesn't eat me first.
She would be hot if she was skinny
I can understand that. With so many really morbidly obese people around, overweight people in comparison can appear normal (like comparing the moon to an elephant-but the elephant is still pretty damn big).
Agree with you 100%, this is a place to mock the obeasts not to circle jerk about how fit/active you are. Narcicism is starting to take a bit of the fun out of browsing around here. I expect an uninterrupted parade of failure on the front page haha
&gt;What a dumb cunt I think they should fire her ass for being intolerant and a bigotIs it just me or is that something a sjw would come out with?
whoa, that's some impressive inverted triangle thing you got going there
I can't stand when I walk around campus and I see fat people in their early 20s. It's like Jesus fucking Christ how did this happen to you? Nice to see a young good looking shitlady.
You know they fucking did, and then dialed up Little Caesars as a reward. They are truly pathetic. And fat.

Yep!
They're like the Special Olympics team but worse and not inspiring.
Vigo from Ghostbusters ll has a fat sister?
Personally I love it.
looks like fat ronda rousey...ugh sorry guys that was an insult to her.
it's huttese. the language of their species
Preach!
She had a water source. Body can last months with only water if you have enough adipose tissue.
Yep.
That's why Korea, Japan and Taiwan will win.
&gt;P.S. *tips fedora*
Friendly reminder that the US used to be the world's leading producer of steel and ships.
Going from low gravity to Earth's gravity would cause their fat to crush their internal organs. A slow and painful death for all of them except the smallest of them.
Not at *any* size. Just fat size. If you're in at a normal BMI, you're anorexic.
Is she even in her own house? Where is all of the slop and filth? There should at least be a pile of chicken bones in a corner.
Is the bottom half of the cottage cheese butt brown? Like, the top is pink...and the bottom is brown...?Oh, no. Oh no no no no no. Why.
What the fuck is that supposed to be?
No one called anyone ugly
For us hard gainers I think it's a little different because I actually burn a lot of those calories, y'know, running, biking, exercise, lifting (something other than my spoon) etc.
I think that life is probably more punishment than free food and shelter for a longer period of time.
I hate that bullshit. I was so excited to go and finally be able to buy bras that fit. I guess 34 bands are not a concept there. The woman took one look at me and told me to go back to VS. I guess I must have fatshamed her with my presence. Isn't that how it works?Hell, the middle schoolers now are wearing torrid and actual lane Bryant. That chubsters vintage stuff would be way too small for them.
they probably mean overweight, not obese. I don't think anywhere in the world has a 60% obesity rate except for very small countires like Samoa and Micronesia.
All the mail carriers I've ever had *have* been in good shape and they all drive everywhere. WTF is this whale blathering on about?
The one I hear most is 'husky'.
*Jollyweigh
She's shaped like Humpty dumpty.
I have read different explanations about that, visceral fat vs. subcutaneous fat, fat that is full of blood capillars vs. the one that has very poor circulation, etc. I'm curious too, I'll have to look into it and report back to the sub.
Well that was revolting.
Exactly. Online. It's that simple.
This guy could even get *me* to go to church.
she's one of those feral hams that turned all mammoth.
So why're your knees red? (ಠ‿ಠ)
Maybe he'll get her fat fucking ass back in shape. He sees the twin and is probably like lets throw her in the gym, lock the doors, and hope for the best.
Those are just her developed finger muscles from working out.../s
I guarantee you they're on disability because they're too fat to work along with welfare and all the other free money they can get their grubby hands on. Taxpayer money is wasted every single day they are allowed to exist.
I guess her fork is attracted to her thyroid.
It's gotta be immediate fear, not 20 years down the road
I know this is going to sound terrible but watching shitbird female cooks out pace me on the rank scale without doing anything drove me batshit.
lol big laugh... you've earned an upvote
I think it's the access to all the food, when I visit other countries, sometimes there's not visible eateries for many blocks. Not here, constant advertisements, sometimes they even get me.  I have to stop and think am I even actually hungry, when was the last time I ate. Jesus fucking Christ even the gym I go to peddles food crack and junk drinks.  People have no idea how many calories are jn things and how much effort is required in burning it off. Oh, that has 600 cals I'll just walk the stairs up to my couch I should be good. It's frustrating sometimes, I try to bring my kid to go have fun somewhere and there's always someone wanting to give her cookies, cake, even suckers at the bank. EVERYWHERE! Even at school I was apalled to find out that they get the choice of fries everyday!! Cupcakes at every birthday.. I could go on and on....
This is why I don't want to get married unless it's to a shitlord.
Agreed. I love stuffing myself full of their chicken nuggets and fries a few times a month.
I realize now that I was discrediting his shitlordiness because it was diluted by other issues. Doesn't change the fact that he hates fatties. Still, this mofo needs Jesus.
This pisses me off too. Every religion has its crazies. I work with some Muslim women and they are very nice and happy to be in America. They're from Somalia. I can't even imagine the hell hole they came from. They came to escape the crazies.
Kill that bitch. It's fucking Detroit, call the cops and say she's attacking you and your child, then stab her to death. A week later, when the cops show up, it'll all be OK.
Just watched the video again. It was actually under a year. It was 9 months. So he was losing over 1lb a week. That's not mediocre weightloss. That's what I aim for when I'm looking to lose weight.
I'm happy to admit this, but I came here after I exhausted every outlet to help my overweight friend lose weight, and he just continued to disregard my advice even after admitting that he needed to lose weight. I would write up a meal plan and he would get fucking pizza. I would tell him to do 15 minutes of walking and he wouldn't do it and he would make excuses.I tried being nice, I tried being supportive, I tried being motivational and nothing worked.There is a point where you stop, you take a step back, you say 'Fuck it' and you come to FPH to unload how fucking annoying it is that 95% of fat people won't do basic things to *save their fucking life*. That's why I would do this.
That's actually really fucking scary.
At least she is burning ^some^^very^^^little calories faking that smile
I went out to the Ape Caves in Oregon last weekend. Would have thought they wouldn't be there... But they were. They quit about 200 yards into the cave, went back out, and sat on some rocks and panted. It was honestly pathetic...
"I thought he was just pranking me,"
I think they taste different but there is nothing wrong with some hot filtered water.
I think you misspelled taxed as executed and incinerated.
I could make myself 5 pairs of panties with the material on that thing...
What a fucking tool..better him than me.
I hate so much about that video. So. Fucking. Much.The part in the beginning, where she goes all snappy bitchface while moving closer to the camre and saying something along the lines of "like I'm supposed to do". God I hate that face. That smug, self centered, "i'm always right"-look that she has, the way her fucking face freezes into that stare at the oment of fingersnap-and close coming. God. Fuck off.Then, what about that fat dude? I admit, he's hilarious in the sense that hes a fat dude dancing funny. I don't mind him at all, but I can't help to feel that he's only there to be made fun of. Why are allt he other men the perfect Ken, while they got one humongous fat dude dancing hilariously. Why not a fat chick? Why not a chick that weighs exactly the same? I'll tell you why, cause fat chicks are fuckin disgusting. fat men can be hilarious, but fat women never are. They're never nice (experience), never positive, never helpful. Just selfish turdwagons wheezing on about their problems and "skinny bitches".Speaking of, what the fuck is up with saying skinny bitches? When did it get acceptable to target anyone with a healthy BMI? I swear, if Kanye made a song where he said "I don't want no lardwagon, keep those fat bitches away" - he'd be under attack from right, left and centrefatfolds. I hate the hypocrisy. I hate the notion that fat people are somehow 'better' cause they love their bodies. I hate that there is a HAES movement at all and that anyone against it or even daring to ask a critical question gets "effyourbeautystandards" in return. I hate that one can't say to a fat chick that she's fat, even though you can clearly say to a skinny chick that she's all meat and bones. Meghan isn't even that fat, not morbidly obese or anything. But I hate her and her attitude. Fuck Meghan Trainor.
Jeezy Pete! You got some knockers lady! I was always jealous of my mom, she's got big boobs and she definitely falls into the REAL definition of curvy, narrow waist an big hips and boobs. I got way more height on her and I always really wished I had those fun curves, but often it seems to be more trouble!
I'm learning a new language...
I'm guessing she forced him to propose
I would like to see a fatty perform a resting flat foot squat.
I think I see facial hair on it...
But you see I was comparing Nazi soldiers boycotting Jewish businesses to a Femi-nazi boycotting white male writers, and you compared another irrelevant example that would still count as unjustified racism.
Not now you don't. You'll always see this tumblrina whenever you think of pearl.
No issue, I just wanted to make sure you didn't look bad in public. We have to watch out for each other. I thought it was a bad choice of words to use... no offense was intended.
Banned for retarded fatlogic.
You just described how I currently attempt to swim :( my new goal after doing a marathon is a Tri. You just triggered me to jog my ass to the pool to work on that
Actually, that sounds delicious. But it would have to be your only bit of food for that meal.
&gt; And it's amazing that they think it's consistent with 'feminism' to encapsulate the entire worth of women in whether men find them hotIt's all about the bass, didn't you hear? Mama told me that it's okay for me to be obese because men think a fat ass is sexy.
That is exactly what they do.Major websites spew out buzzwords on content most likely to attract likes and shares. People like her treat it like cake and cannot have enough. She heard somewhere that people oppress her and want to take away her food so now "The Patriarchy" is after her.

Thin privilege is also parking far away from others and walking the difference because I'm shit at parking.
Oh my god. That poster. If I weren't broke as hell I would gild this so fast.
It's super easy to use a bamboo drawing tablet. I have one. Plug in, upload the program, and go. I mean the directions are seriously that simple. There has to be something mentally wrong with her. In which case, I don't feel right making fun of her.
I have never heard anyone making fun of a fatty at the gym except for other fatties. Bullshit detector going off.
What country are you in? Or maybe you just wear your shirts too big dawg. 5'11 147 is seriously slim, there's no way you don't swim in mediums...

&gt; Like at some point do they absolutely need a horse dicked dude to get laid because normal peen isn't long enough to make it through the flab to the pussy? Actually yes, right on the money.There's a Fetlife group centered on black women x white men, someone in my friends list commented there a few weeks back so I clicked through to look and the women in that thread were talking about how "hung" BEGINS at 10 inches.

You're welcome here as long as you're not fat so keep commenting around and get verified. But don't mistake my dry sense of humour, because it was a joke... Like the rest of the comments.
And that, kids, is the face of addiction!
I know for a fact that Johnson and Johnson used to do that, maybe they still do.
Hundreds of years ago it was pretty cool to just beat women, and kill people for having different beliefs, and own slaves. It was a primitive and ass-backwards time. And anyone trying to take us BACK to that is a fucking asshole.
maybe theyre three feet tall.

I'd put her at 140-150, it's less than the american average now, not near a ham, in all reality not really bad. The after photos? Amazing, she has a great figure.
260? hahahhaha. Ahahahha.
yeah, for the most part we're ordinary folk who are tired of all the bullshit
you should come over to the Weihnachtsmarkten in Germany and eat Grünkohl sometime, it's boerenkool chopped up very fine with some herbs and shit, delicious if you ask me! Served with various meats and potato foods
Thanks! Worthless indeed, just gets frustrating at times. Then I think of Victoria's Secret and 2949824982 beautiful bikinis that I can wear in the summer and go back to being my merry self.
For me, I always felt weird because I was always taller than everyone in my family. So, I always wore bigger pants or shirts or shoes. I mean, I have two cousins that are twins and they are 4"11'. I honestly don't know what happened with me because everyone in my family is short, female wise. The men are average height. And that, coupled with being a preteen that was taller than everyone, just took its toll. Guys never really wanted to date me from 7-10th grade because I was so much taller than them. I was always one of the guys because I enjoyed video games and stuff.I don't know, I felt like I couldn't control my height, but I could sure as fuck control my weight. I definitely hated my body. And at first, I knew I didn't need to lose weight (I've always been thin, it's genetics) but after a while, I started to get paranoid anytime I ate anything. And then I would see fat where there was nothing but bones. That's when the throwing up and laxatives started.
Drink lots of tea and eat according to your TDEE (or -500 during cut) to surpress the feeling of hunger. Any sensation of hunger you still feel is weakness.
And even in cartoons, they have to push a nog with a White woman. Gotta keep up that interracial breeding propaganda, goy.
I sort of figured that was where it was going but as soon as he dropped his pants, I noped out of there.
I'll never understand why this isn't considered child abuse.
What a disgusting sack of lard that bears no helpfulness by existing on this earth. Pathetic and gross.
When I grab my boob like this, I actually have room in my hand for more. At any other time that would make me sad, but looking at this, I'm actually happy about it lol
They taste ok. Personally, I'd also try dipping it in dark chocolate because it's a strawberry, so why not. Fruit is nature's candy! The difference between me and a fat person is that I won't eat them all by myself in 5 minutes and then make another batch to do it again.
Is it just lining up perfectly, or is she checking out a 36-count pack of chocolate bars?
Hey remember science class? Grease and fire don't mix!
Woomp, there it is.
this person is a cycle speaker.tits bother her? she covers them up, which i do too (34-C).belly bothers her? there is no solution... meanwhile the only thing she can control is her belly size... and my point is that if she dropped fat, the tits will go along with it.killing 2 birds with one stone.
**LOOK AT IT!**
I wouldn't feel bad. They probably have nothing in common with you, they lie about their weight, so they probably lie just as much about their interests and personality.
After working in retail for a period, I can't explain how accurately this describes the way she's supporting herselfedit: grammar
damn I just gained up to 60KG when I was 18, and then I went back down to 55 when I started climbing more.
Yeah you fat. Now roll along our of here. Get!
That's just it, it's a lifestyle choice. But here's the thing that they don't seem to understand: it gets easier to exercise and eat healthier when you make it into a routine. The effort isn't all that much but apparently it's still too much for fatasses.
I collect them and I noticed that right away. Its even worse than a fake Louis however as the fakes will have the Louis symbol and the higher end ones are almost impossible to tell unless you look inside. This is just made to resemble one. Ugh.
Ow.
Omg guys I fucking see the light now. This comment truly spoke to me. I can't believe how horrible I've been. It's right, we should stop hating these enormous amorphous beings and start sleeping with them. They really ARE beautiful.But Honestly... Are you fucking retarded or something?
On a serious note, it could be a person with some type of dwarfism.

I'm pretty sure a fuckload of digestion is what's going on in that body.
It is funny, shame nothing xan burn coming from a butthurt fatty.
I'm of the opinion that people who are grotesquely overweight shouldn't go in public. Seriously. That's literally disgusting to look at when eating. I'd say the same would apply to any body type or dis figuration that most people would consider a gross site.
She's 110 lbs of fat hate, and we send each other things like this all the time. We met through soccer and bond over enjoying food in moderation and hating those who don't :)
Can you imagine being married to this monster?
Wicked, the next step is to take it down from 35 to 25, unless you're swole as fuck.
Seconded. I just feel like they're settling for someone not worthy of them. In particular I've got a friend who got married at 18 and his partner has since blimped and I feel bad because he's in an incredibly tough situation, they've got so much history and a life together it'd be really hard for him to leave the relationship. Doesn't mean I have respect for the fatty I just feel that sometimes there are contributing factors to marrying/staying with a fatty.
I'm watching my sister slowly transform into a stereotypical fat college feminist. I don't talk to her much these days now since any effort I could make will be met with hostility from her and undermining from our parents. It sucks to lose someone I was once close with, but I've battled my family's vices and addictions for years, and the only way to save myself was to abandon that sinking ship.

It's pi (3.1415 - 3/14/15) day, not pie day. Clearly fatties will find a way though.
It means that people feel they have a right to comment on the bodies of strangers, and that's not okay. Even fat people have a right to work, live, go about their lives, exists.
lmao at whale thinking only certain calories count towards daily caloric intake. how fucking stupid can you get
18 and 19 are teenage years.
They should have added in stretch marks, flap sores, chin hair and acne 99% of obese people have. Then we'd see how attractive they still find it.
Is this some plus sized version of their store, like Torrid is for Hot Topic?

What does this man know of human rights? Does he not know of the struggles of people all around the world who have too little to eat and not too much?He was given a chance to live a healthy life. And he failed. Like every other fatty. He made his bed, now he can lie on it. He should not use his position in order to force the world to help him when there are other people in so much more need of helping.
&gt; Evidently, someone found tiles used in the tattoo stamp device a few months ago. (link[1] ; link[2] ; link[3] ; link[4] ) These were only used for chest tattoos, however.I emailed Carlos Porter a while back when those stories broke to let him know that they had found (!) the alleged tattooing equipment. We had a good laugh and he let me know that most of the grotesque relics that are shown ("bone crushers" used to mangle the feet of live jews, etc...) are simply old pieces of farm equipment that were never used to hurt anyone.well, guess what I found just seconds ago while image searching for "tattoo digits"!!URLor3/4 of the way down on this page URLLooks like The Cattle Shop Australia is selling evil National Socialist jew-tattooing equipment!!! Let's all grab ourselves a piece of history at low low prices.
You wouldn't believe the speed a ham can reach if it feels its blood sugahs are low or it sees it might have to wait longer for its big mac. Obviously this only lasts for a second or two before it collapses on the floor in a heap wheezing and sweating profusely.

I've mentioned this around here before but did anyone else notice that the male romantic interest in the video was... a conventionally attractive lean man? The one fat guy featured prominently in the video was basically just a silly clown because everyone knows fat guys aren't attractive and could never be seen as sex objects.Fat women on the other hand are gorgeous! /sAll this fat acceptance bullshit is *female* fat acceptance. Fat women want to be considered beautiful so they can be with beautiful men i.e. not fat neckbeards.Guess what, you're not beautiful. Why? Because you're fat. It is very obvious from just briefly glancing at you that you're sick and being sick and weak and all that stuff kind of doesn't interest people sexually.Saying curves are sexy (not the real curves many women naturally have but the curves of an enormous belly) makes about as much sense as saying that the yellowed skin of an alcoholic whose liver is failing is attractive. No it isn't, it shows they're sick.
It is physiologically impossible to gain 200lbs of muscle as an adult human male who is below 15 feet tall.
What the fuck is wrong with this thing? How fucked up is your brain when "I'm going to start a movement" sounds more sensible than "I'm gonna drop the chalupa and pick up a dumbbell"? Is it just because whining on the internet doesn't require you to actually do anything? How many calories does starting a petition burn? Is it enough so that you "earn" that triple-fudge, cherry crumble, extra-large coffee milkshake with extra cream cheese frosting? Fuck, man. Be normal-sized and you won't have to "start a campaign".
I want to give this kid an in shape and buff pikachu for this.
Funny, I don't recall them being the ones doing the massacre... The allies were winning, sure, but not slaughtering Germans. The Jews were a tad busy being rounded up and put in camps, then systematically killed by said Nazis.
But... this post just proves she eats for 4 and she knows it.How much of an idiot can someone be to say she eats almost nothing but also admit she eats as much as 4 people?
Fat doesn't just happen. You are not a victim of the fat fairy. You get fat by being lazy, careless, undisciplined, pessimistic, self centered, self absorbed and unsocial. You might be cute and funny and nice sometimes, but you all these other things most of the time. People don't like fat people because of the way they act, because of what they represent. I'm not skinny, I've been controlling my weight (sometimes not very well) all my life. When I see someone who has just stopped caring what they look like, how they feel, how they look at the world, I don't like them.
I'm so fucking mad &gt;:(

Yes, and the trans community is (in my opinion) the worst there is for that. For the most part, trans-men, non-binary individuals, and trans-women who aren't bleach-blonde basic straight white girls are seen as the 'lesser trans' so to speak. I've really come to hate the community.
Yeah, you are a weirdo for liking fit girls. Men like curves!
&gt; Fat people should receive socialize healthcare for the same reason smokers, drinkers, or drug abusers should. In the end these people wont get care anyway. Their conditions prevent them from many treatment options, for the illnesses they will develop because of their life styles.

How do you know there were no obese cavemen?
You're assuming that kids don't like ANY healthy food and that you have to MAKE them like it, which simply isn't trueEdit: also, easy solution-don't keep chocolate/sweets in the house
This is kind of a stupid thing to say, I know a ton of fat doctors some with multiple PhDs. Granted they aren't in the majority, but to make a correlation between overeating and writing a dissertation is just a terrible argument. It's just not as fun making fun of fatties if it doesn't make any sense.
He hasn't. He only proved he isn't fat.
So you are a vegetarian then. Non vegetarians literally never think about that when they're eating delicious cow meat.

Personally, my SO loves that I take good care of all those things. Lol he makes me take care of his nails too, since he thinks I do such a good job on mine. That being said, this story is still very /r/thathappened.
Talking about stupid vietnamese cave paintings also gets you benned.

What the fuck is going on here? Are you still a fucking fatass or what?
I'm against that. I have a high metabolism and a very physical demanding job which makes keeping a healthy weight difficult for me. Sometimes I want that double quarter pounder to help out with the calories.If anything, they should have to pay extra health insurance. They are going to most likely have more health issues that could have been avoided. I shouldn't have to support their horrible habits.
RAAAGE! This pisses me off! It makes me so angry I don't even know if I can properly form words to describe why I'm so pissed at this.There is so much narcissism in this post that it boggles my mind. These fat assholes whine and cry about body acceptance and all this other BS, and they are LYING through their mayo-coated teeth! They don't accept their bodies. They talk about being curvy goddesses, but deep down they know they're fat, disgusting pigs! This idiot was "triggered" from guilt and self-loathing, and everybody else just needs to accept and coddle her for her self-loathing and not make her confront the reason why she feels that way (she is an oinker). No, the whole family needs to revolve around her and her fee fees!Wait. You know what? That actually makes sense. Everybody *should* revolve around her since she probably has the same gravitational pull as the sun.
Oh gotcha. My bad.

Dumb posts like this make following Rule 3 really difficult.
Wow, this is the first post in a while that actually made me say 'what in the fuck is that?'
Fat girls can only get defective skinny guys. Something is always wrong with those dudes. Always.
Ugh,no. If she is getting fat and disgusting its time to end the relationship. Do you know what a relationship is without attraction? A friendship.
Haven't tried that yet

That excuse is the exact reason I am alive. My mum kept saying she couldn't get pregnant due to her doctor telling her she would never have children, my dad wanted a family and they almost broke up over it, then SURPRISE! I came along!
Same here in germany in the next city where I live at: no Beetus King, no KFC, only 1 McBeetus left after closing the one located in the city center.But sadly, when I take a look around, people are ~~working~~ feeding hard to catch up with the US in general.
Chris’s weight loss tips&gt;If you’re going to eat something that is less than perfectly healthy, make sure you have something that of really good quality, including bread and chocolate. Have one glass of really great wine rather than drinking a whole bottle of rubbish.Hams will take this as an invitation to eat a pound of Hershey's and an entire Little Caesar's pizza with their ranch drink.&gt; Try not to eat for 12 hours overnight and if you can do moderate exercise in the morning before breakfast your body will start burning its emergency fuel reserve: your body fat.Lol, the bro-science.&gt; Having caffeine first thing in the morning helps you concentrate, gives you more stamina and helps your fat cells open up and release the fat to the bloodstream, so it’s an enhanced fat-burner.More bro-science.This guy has 0 knowledge on any of the actual science behind exercising and weight loss, but good for him for becoming a normal person.
Same here. The Midwest is a black hole for finding non fats to date, depending on where you're at.
I usually don't get hungry until like 3 pm. The idea of waking up and eating a meal right away makes my stomach hurt.
Of course its Walmart.
"she's been having a hard time lately about the way she looks" So she fucking should. Why do these lard-beasts insist on taking naked photos and throwing them all over the internet?

make it into a gameshow as well!
I have no doubt that I will receive flack for this but I am over the "make fun of fatties but don't comment about what they eat because sometimes I eat the same stuff" comments that keep popping up in this sub. No one here is calling out another ShitLord/Lady for eating that crap, which by the way, even OP refers to as "shit" because it *is in fact shit!* We are making fun of fatties! And we are making fun of them and their disgusting habits. There are a wide-range of Shits on here — some with rocking bodies because they workout and eat "clean" (which has totally different meanings depending what dietary camp you are in), some who are thin naturally despite what they eat, and others who may be thin from other avenues (ie ED). No one here is judging another Shit for why they are thin or the foods that they consume. There are countless published research articles linking obesity to the very foods that are being mocked so we are entirely justified throwing that in their face as much as the fact that they are too lazy to exercise. For all the Shits who eat shitty food — we aren't calling you out on it! You clearly know how to portion control yourself OR you likely go on an few extra long runs to offset any crappy food you consume. I too have an autoimmune disorder (2 actually) so I am hyperaware of what I consume but by no means do I feel bad when someone makes fun of a fatty for eating In-N-Out and I just ate animal fries. Instead I'm happy knowing that I *can* eat animal fries, run a few extra miles, and NOT look like a HamBeast.OP — Eat your heart out and maintain a healthy weight! We are all on your side.Now that I feel that I was nice and supportive... to all Shits : stop worrying about your feelings getting hurt and get to the *actual* point of this sub: **making HamBeasts look and feel like disgusting vile creatures by *any means* necessary!**
At least gay dudes stay in shape
BMI is pretty universal, since it's just an equation using meters and kilograms (or converted feet/inches and pounds). The article uses a BMI &gt;25 for overweight and &gt;30 for obese, so it's to the same standard.
God damn it, I really hate this 'victim worship' cult. Everything is oppressive! You are virtuous by dint of being oppressed! Fit people are evil for not being victims!
that comment made me laugh so much, hereredditsilver.jpg
Add it to the fap folder.
Wtf I can lose that much weight in one day by taking a shit drinking all day all night and then taking a poop again.
As a gay dude, honestly nothing is wrong, he is decently attractive, and he is in shape, from what I can tell from the photo in the OP.
this would also work quite nicely in /r/punchablefaces
Yeah, but the flights at Kitty Hawk had to last longer than ones with her on the plane.
I've told my wife and we have a mutual agreement if either one of us stops caring about ourselves then why should the other.
why the fuck these hams never got bras that fit thoseriouslywhy
Well, a lot of us are into working out and often cut so this would be of use to many people.
I swear I've seen her before. Why does she look familiar?
Lol more like 'Jabba the Gut'
I think it came about before the whole PC bullshit started, limited is a bit different and its more of a tier system with bombs and then removal taking the highest spots. Constructed requires a little more specific language since the role players need to be alot more specific to the situation.
nah man, that's not counting the other fast food stores. 3 macs a day, 3 whoppers, 3 jumbo jacks, and a bucket of chicken before bed, and if its a cheat day, she gets a gallon of ice cream too, and lets be honest, every fucking day is cheat day.
I'm sure she thinks she has an anaconda all the girls are jealous of.
Poor guy just wants the Academy to lower their standards for The Oscars.
The best years of his life are wasted. Imagine what this fat fuck will look like in 10 years, that's if he lives that long.
They have continued to try and justify their point and other shitlords have joined my side. I added what was said in the comments.
Exactly what I was thinking. We have a lot of small liberal art colleges in and around the city. We also have plenty of large universities. I go to one of the above. So at some level I can understand. From what I can understand, they want to draw attention to "Black Lives Matter", their cause. This does accomplish that. However, it accomplishes it in a negative light. Now they have created a strong negative reinforcement between their cause and the public. A social cause is not a public corporation, any publicity is not good publicity. They need to create a lasting positive impression with the public. Also most of the protesters were white. Good for them for getting involved but for fucks sake you're creating negative reinforcement with a community you don't belong to.A problem with my generation is they think social activism has to be disruptive. The riots in Ferguson. Killing Cops in protest to Eric Garner. Occupy Wallstreet harassing the working community. Hand out some fucking lollipops. Get the public involved inform them of the facts. Also, besides racist red necks and grandmas with dementia, who the fuck is arguing that black lives don't matter? All lives matter. It's like people who argue against rape culture. Show me one person who thinks rape is not a heinous crime that violates the victim at every level imaginable and I'll show them to a mental institution. Sorry i just took Adderal.

There's this fucking pant load that wrote a book about his weight loss. Used to weigh 505 pounds and then lost all the weight. I see people talking about how great he is and all this other bullshit. Come to find out he put all the fucking weight back on.
The main hate with that scrub was that it created microtears in your skin and that could very easily lead to infection aka acne.  But they also seem to forget their tagline is YMMV so if it works it works. Everyone's skin is different
&gt; FAs do seem to ricochet between being outraged that companies don't make clothes for them (so they can give them money) and boycotting said companies to try to drive them out of business. How can they boycott a company when that company doesn't sell anything they could buy anyway?It's like me boycotting Express (a clothing store) for not selling Blue Buffalo cat food. I'll show them! I won't buy my cat food there!Yeah.
Or the lack thereof
hohoho thar she blows!! XD!!! speaking of which have you seen the size of the original xbox?
I think that just standing and being still would probably burn more calories than what she's doing
That...reminds me of a hovercraft.

I'd really wish Boogie2988 wasnt fat.
Tommy Wiseau confirmed as a fat fetishist.
Nobody is saying that his weight is okay and he isn't making excuses for it. What is he doing then? Bringing the whole gaming industry forward.
I'll be downvoted to hell by fellow shitlords but maybe it's because boobs really are less impressive when you do a ton of fat-burning routines. Like, I hate the fatties in there too, but there are people NOT bitching about the fat and instead complaining how it really is genetics if you can put the work into that slim figure and still be a perky DD. Go ahead and call me a fatty for disagreeing (because that's the only negative noun in this sub) but some of those comments are justified.
Gaming up/down votes can be very profitable if say, you have a company and up vote your ad to the front page. Then, to be consistent, this rule gets applied everywhere. Furthermore, it prevents inter-sub drama of brigades going back and forth downvoting everything and screwing up the communities.TL:DR more reasons to ban it than not to
What a load of shit.
Exactly. Fat moms + dead babies = premeditated murder. It's like putting somebody in a room, turning on the gas, leaving, and being surprised that they're dead by the time you come back. "Oh my bad, I didn't know carbon monoxide kills people" wouldn't work too well in court.

Do you know how bad i want donuts? A bacon cheeseburger?? BEER??? I stay in good shape in general, but I have a work trip to Cancun tomorrow- so 3 mon ago i tightened my diet up hardcore. Upped my cardio to an hour a day and put some extra focus in my lifts. I plan to be the best shaped 30 something on this trip. There are no pastries, pies, or treats that would be better than being in amazing shape on this trip- i cant even fathom the lack of self respect that would cause someone slightly older than me to weigh almost 200lb more than me and DIE WALKING... People disgust me...
As much as I find these people disgusting to look at, and how much I hate their stupid reasons for not being able to lose weight and their complete lack of willpower to do/eat/drink the right things - I do have to agree that as long as you're happy with the body you're in, then it's your business. Just don't go around pushing your beliefs and reasons on other people trying hard to lose weight or get in shape. It took a a lot of effort and willpower and changes in lifestyle and diet to get to where I am today - Male, 178 cm, 72kg (from 95kg) All along the way I had fat friends discouraging me to lose weight, giving me flack about "starvation mode" and small meals throughout the day and that I would simply "die from a heart attack" with a keto diet.It's all well and good as they're good, close, long-term friends and they probably didn't mean any insult. But I sure found it hurtful when I had put so much effort into eating right, taking up cardio, giving up frequent alcohol, junk food, fast food and binging on sugar. This is coming from a lifestyle where eating burgers and chips from McDonald's at 3am was a common thing for me.

&gt; forced my mom to put a stick of butter in our Christmas nativity scene cause I was so passionate about Yeah! I -- Wait... What?
They think they're "starving" because the concept of hunger pangs are alien to them. I saw a show where an obeast was admitted into hospital, put on a proper diet and asked the doctor about "a weird pain" in it's stomach. Turns out it forgot what being hungry feels like.
The asian girl looks like she wants to kill her, She's probably thinking "If i stab her will it even get past that massive layer of fat?"
pizza threats is up there.
It's unfortunate that grown women are thinking it works and actually buying it. like I said, people will do literally anything else except to eat healthy and work out to stay fit.
Good. Get the fat fucks out of the gym, too. There's nothing worse than when I'm working out and a ham is just standing around blocking my view of a nice ass on a shitlady in yoga pants. The gym is much more attractive in March than it is in January.
I don't think I can handle a *real* woman like that
Ew, no. Hammy dropping a deuce on camera is not something to monitor
Or FUPAdancing.
Nothing against hunters? There is nothing worst that hunters. They are worst than fatties. Coward son of of bitches.I would only support hunt hunters.

That sub has gone to shit since the SRS style mods started taking over there. I'm *very* suspicious that they are starting to get involved in shit here, but I certainly hope that I am wrong.
there is a lot of deceit and trickery in these movies, while the moral is simple and does not hold up well.
To be fair I'd vote for a loaf of bread it Teddy Roosevelt endorsed it.
Yes, because when you have sausage rolls like that for legs, you want to accentuate them with shitoos.
Is there a follow up to that video?
Shitlord here, never been above 23 bmi in my life. Also never eaten salad. When it comes to staying slim, all that is required is NOT having a huge excess of calories. You can do that on pizza and ice cream. Granted, your arteries won't be thanking you, but you can do it. Which is why it's bullshit when fats try to use the false dichotomy of "fat or salad every meal". I've never touched a salad in my life. I just don't turn eating into a goddamn hobby.
My panties remain firmly in place.

Yeah I can imagine how daunting a lifestyle change is when we expect you to not eat a bag of cookies, two bags of potato chips and McDonalds for every meal.
She certainly is in shape (round is a shape)
sorry, but referring to another person as 'it' is just revolting and dehumanizing.
Fake? Fake!?Don't you know? Every time a fattie downvotes a pizzasista4lyfe gets a free topping at papa johns
Still a better love story than Twilight
The first picture in the album is an older one of the fat girl sorority on my campus! They're still just as fat though... They even hold a cookie sale during finals week advertising people to 'ΣΔΤ' late....they didn't help their pr there...
It looks like those clothes: t-shirt and shorts are made with similar dimensions as the clothes for normal people only 8' tall. So while he still has height of normal person, wearing those clothes make him look like a gigantic fat toddler who wears his older brother's clothes which are too long for him.
The *horror*!

Video games? Where are the studies for this shit?
Something similar happened to me at Bass Pro a few months ago. I was standing at the outer edge of an aisle that must have been 10 feet across, looking at fishing rods with my boyfriend. I look up to see two planets on mobility scooters motoring right at me! I quickly pressed myself up to the edge of the aisle, narrowly missing a collision with this thing who shot me a dirty look as it sped by. I just gaped in confusion. Even my nice and naive boyfriend thought it may have been on purpose.
That looks fun as fuck to do though.
This is very sad
Not even moses could part that shit.
That sack of shit is going to die from obesity.
What I love about this picture is that you can't tell how fucking huge she is. Yes, she is fat but fatter than that fatty you just pictured in your mind. Add 100 pounds to whatever weight you imagined her to be at.
I can't even eat 1/4 of a Kinder egg without getting an upset stomach. How the fuck does she manage all that?
Who goes to the gym wearing a sweater and necklaces?
I'd be happy to acknowledge thin privilege if fatties would acknowledge that privileges can be earned.
There's already a great chance they can't even see their dicks.
Holy crap I just saw that first scene where she *SITS* on the dude and I thought for sure his chest was gonna look [like this](URL
&gt;Why is she even there by herself? I would guess it's because she did not fit in her assigned seat?
Why would a fatty have their wedding at the city museum? You can hardly fit into any of those tiny holes.
They're overgrown children. It's very sad.
There's an old story where I'm from about mixing 10 gallons of ice cream with 1 gallon of manure. You end up with 11 gallons of manure. Pic in OP summarizes this nicely, as I cannot get a boner with that canvas sack of cottage cheese in the shot.
Only to fat people. "Normal" people know that it's normal to be normal.
But how do you know she's fat? I get it, she is indeed stupid, but eating ice cream is not a sin.
to go to McDonalds and supplies(beetus) from Walmart.
I'm getting giddy picturing them do 110m hurdles. Holy shit, imagine diving!
Well that is true
This just in: people like looking at attractive fit people more than ugly fatties, and they help sell products. If this shit weren't effective at pushing product, then the companies wouldn't do it. Companies have no vested interested in some social issue, they are just looking for ways to increase their profits. Pretending this is social pressure is just goddamn stupid.
I think it's a 3XL camo yamaka?
What she meant was your dick is probably too small. I bet she's onto something.
I had my grandpa over from south america with an aunt I've never met, since I live in europe. Went to another city where the majority of my family lives amd where we had a huge party with the rest of our very big (as in many people) family. I had some younger cousins in their late teens that I was given "charge" of to keep an eye on so that they didn't drink too much. The evening went on pretty smoothly and I had some good weed with me. They have all smoked before amd had been naggin me the whole night to roll one. So at 2 am or something I finally gave in and rolled one. I'll admit I made it a little bit stronger. One cousin and her bf went for a walk while me and the other 2 went back. 30 min pass when one of my cousins quickly stands up with a glassy stare and pouting cheeks, I can see what's going on here so I take a deep breath and head to fetch some water and paper. Sure enough when that thought had finished he pukes his guts out on the dance floor in front of the whole family. At pretty much the same time I get a call from my cousins bf who, with some difficulty, manages to tell me that they've passed out on some stairwell somewhere in a town I don't know. Damn amateurs.So yeah I had a pretty good new years eve!Edit:It should be added that I, of course, take full blame and responsibilty for this fuckup.

I have the explanation, friend, and it is called **IGD**: Instant Gratification Disorder.Do you expect to see results in your new diet 2 days after you started? You might have IGD.Do you enjoy eating food even after becoming "full"? You might have IGD.Do you feel like the door lock doesn't disengage fast enough after swiping your pass? You might have IGD.Do think it is OK to be unhealthy because "I feel fine right now". You might have IGD.*[Fat person stereotype]*. You might have IGD.

Because admitting that they're disgusting and that they hate themselves might inspire them to change, and god forbid they have to eat less food in order to do so.
Eventually, they'll have to do so much photoshop that they may as well not even take the pictures.
I'm gonna write a "fitness" book that doesn't involve dieting or exercise and panders to *feelz* instead.I'm gonna make a million dollars from fat people.
I'm fat. None of my friends are fat. But, I also don't act like this fucking loser.
How exactly do fatties think a person gets a 6-pack?
I mean I'm not that scared but I can see how some people could be. They're moving metal stairs. Lose your footing when you step and you'll not only fall on metal edges, but you'll continue to get hurled more than if it were stairs due to the fact that they're always moving. This can be even more scary (personally this scares me a lot) when there's a lot of people riding it. Being bunched up, each having a step to yourself makes everything from above, 100x worse.

I couldn't agree more. I grew up in a community of hippies and NO ONE was fat. I took a retail job during college and worked at a local mall and... WOW. It blew my fucking mind. Kids as young as 6 WADDLING instead of walking. Kids still in STROLLERS who looked obese. Absolutely sickening. These fat fuck parents are killing their kids, you're right. Damning them to unhealthy, unproductive, unhappy, and ultimately short lives.Unforgivable in my mind.

Like I said: it's possible I'm just lucky. At $125 per DEXA scan, I'm happy I can rely on my $150 scale every morning to give me a number that appears to make sense.As a former ham (lost ~100lbs over the last year), I watched my BF consistently move down week over week; it was nice to have DEXA confirm my numbers.

Oh my god, FIVE PAIRS. 5. This has to be a joke or a lie or something! I still have the same jeans I wore in 9th grade for crying out loud.I guess thin privilege is not ever having ripped a pair of pants.
He looks like he's about to start laughing at any moment.Incidentally: is that a wedding ring?
Simple and perfectly stated.
... this is starting to sound like something I should livestream and charge admission for.
Gonna have to agree. I guess male, but it could easily be, and I'm using this term loosely, a woman.
It's almost overwhelming how ugly they are. Fat disfigures.
This reminds me of that episode of the Simpsons where Homer tries to claim disability from being fat and had his fupa on the towel bar. Similar thing probably happened here.
Fats shouldn't be allowed to wear pants without a belt. She should've wore a ~~table cloth~~ long tunic to cover her ass. Hope this isn't an office where clients stop by for a visit. Yuck.

Seriously it looked like this barely fazed him. My favorite was his cat noticing it was feeding time got safely out of arm's reach.
Not even once.
Does it work the other way with female hams? Because there's a theory that female planets are hairy, smelly, have deeper voices, and are sometimes more aggressive because being a planet causes them to produce more testosterone.... it makes sense, and honestly it's fitting that the fatter these things balloon, the less distinguishable they are.
I love milk tho.Currently it's cucumbers with a bit of salt and pepper, but I also really dig fresh corn from the cob, but it's not in season yet. yours?
Tries to hold it against her there at the end "they gave me a hug by the way". Even if she wasn't fat, bitch she didn't want you coming into her personal space, and she even said shes sick, fuck off about it.
I noticed that too. Fucked up narcissism.

I just want to say that I'm fucking sick of them using the term "policing". As much as I would love to be given a badge and told to arrest fatties on sight, that isn't the same as simply saying out loud that I think fat people are disgusting.
Slippery slope. Next thing you know we'll be congratulating people for losing weight and becoming normal sized. I also find it really annoying when people address the lurking fats. I'm not here to talk to them, motivate them or engage with them. The fact that they even lurk here irritates me, but I find people addressing them even more irritating.
Sex with food?
Fucking pigs don't realize that wearing underwear instead of dykewear doesn't make them not fat, it just makes them more disgusting because we can see more.God damn it, I hate what this world is coming to

Awesome. Just awesome.
AHHHHHH shit like this makes my brain explode!!!!!
I worked at a homey country themed restaurant. It was 2 part egg to 1 part cream, and absolutely disgusting. The main breakfast meal was 3 sausages, 2 slices of bacon, mushrooms fried in butter, some tomato relish, toast, grilled tomato, and 2 eggs cooked any way. Washed down with a coke.
Well, I got to thank her for that. Only reinforces the fact that fat people ARE liars.
I'm guessing that red belt is supposed to "define her waist" but it just gets sucked into the fat.
[All I see](URL
Hopefully that party is on the first floor.
Yeah, trust me, that "extra" money is not worth getting married. Considering most of the wives are stay at home moms (lol). I have a job making more than my husband even without the BAH. Most dependent women prey on young men in the military. I hate them they are seriously disgusting.
How can she even begin to THINK that she is beautiful? Is there some brain damage from eating to much sugar?
Why are there fatty chairs on military bases? Have they accepted my plan of dropping obeasts onto enemies?
That is the largest head that may once have belonged to a human that I've ever seen. It's like someone took a face and sewed it onto a beach ball and then had a hive of bees attack it.
I agree with just_pure_energy and deadf00t.Banned.
help me
&gt; fph hates only one type of people and that's fat peopleI'd take that further and suggest that we disapprove of fat people that are unwilling to make an effort to NOT be fat. Most of us would applaud someone of size if they were at a gym working it off.  It's more the "I can't help it" excuses that drive us nucking futs.
Dinitrophenyl. But it can be toxic in high doses. My mate went from 96Kg to 62Kg in just over *one month* by being inches from death's door.
Fph hates all fats equally.
Time for a new username
I was there for allergy medication, so it was completely unrelated. Don't really need a second opinion as I'm completely sane when it comes to my body. I'm perfectly healthy(except for my damn allergies) and at this point I have had too many negative experiences with doctors to even care about getting a "professional" opinion.
They have no fucking clue
What do you think he's trying to do? That's his annual cleaning.
I've always heard it's a bit of a bore and people just read it because it's taboo or because they're curious.
Is it his shadow or did he just eat all the photons in proximity?
Female I think. Check out the earrings on it.
butofcourse piggie picks a shitbird to obsess about.the last pic... I like to imagine it is chronological order, and it's the most recent pic of him... defeated now. Dejected. Reality setting in. The girl is never, ever, going to be into him. Ever.
Wait..this isn't a real picture of fatties? MY LIFE IS A LIE
As an Indian person it confounds me to no end how these fat girls actually decide to wear this and go out in public. Most girls with pudge wouldn't dare to wear a sari knowing the were fat. The only women who get away with it are older women and they usually cover their pudge with the remaining fabric
eww....
That sounds about right.
Well, no shit, you're a mod :)still nice to see we got a mostly evenly balanced mix of shitlords on here though!
There is NOTHING wrong with that. Most of a relationship is attraction. Its part of nature. You will want to "mate" with someone who looks physically appealing. You work hard for your body why shouldnt you want someone that respects themselves just as much? One.of my favorite things about being a shitlady is that i can have a preference of wanting a nice muscular man.
My favorite is the one that looks like it's head is sticking out of a table, only the table is it's chest!
I feel like she believes she already looks like the right. If she saw these side by side she might die of shock.
Whenever there's a picture on this subreddit that shows them with food or snacks I usually calculate the calories out of curiosity. Their snacks are usually more calories than my meals, and their meals are more than what I eat in a whole day.
They don't want a real solution, they want a magic fix that lets them do all the shit they did before, but without consequences.
Especially since we know they will more than likely over estimate the amount of calories that they burn.And I agree if a fattie is trying to use mfp to lose weight they should only focus on staying below their calorie limit without factoring exercise until they actually develop willpower and some self control. And relying on the calorie figures provided by mfp isn't the best thing since it seems to over estimate. Which is why I use a heart rate monitor.
That pig is actually adorable.
Are you talking about the bit where he says we're at the top of the food chain (actually, I think it was OUT of the food chain) and imagine if we had to shoo off some predator while on our way to work etc.? Because if you are, I don't recall him saying anything about that situation being good.If you aren't, do you know where I might find it?
He won't ask for sex cause he probably has obesity induced ED.
Hahaha hahaha hahaha :D i freaking love the shitlord community
Not just any running club. Look for a local track club with USATF membership.

Boo this man.
I wonder if it knows what delusion and lies mean?
I couldn't agree more, but then they would be shunned like lululemon.
&gt;stank-oysterI genuinely lol'd.
I think the creature made a good choice in its tattoo artist. Granted its a little hard to tell with all the shitty filters and stupid after-effects but the tats look legit to me. They will look like shit if it ever loses the weight though...
Yes please :)
That's disappointing another petit 5'2" and I used to rely of old navy for their short style jeans. I have a pair of 6s that fit so well. But they're a few years old. Looks like I'll have to find my replacements elsewhere.
HAHAHAAHA HER BELLY IS THE SAME BUT HER BOOBS ARE SMALLER.
This guy is a culmination of everything I hate the most.
Wipes his greasy hand on his shirt. Ugh.
I'm super hoping I get some. Look at my recent post history.
He said he was a "bear" because he didn't want to put "chub". Lol.
&gt; ‘He was very excited about going and when I said it seemed very expensive he replied that love has no price.Well...unless your fat! (Downvote all you want fatties, you delusional lying sacks of shit. You say you're happy being FAT, then why the fuck would you pretend to be skinny... Oh that's right, cause the majority of the human race finds you repulsive!!)edit: formating
See the worst part about Subway is we are "hard" to order from (real customers words). At other fast food joints, you have numbers to choose. At subway we have bread, meat, sauces, and vegetables you can get in any order. No sub comes pre-made. So any semblance of intelligence people have when they walk in the door is left outside. You will never understand the epitome of human ignorance until someone replies "Yeah" to "What kind of bread will you have today sir?" And stare at you with glazed over eyes until you pick one out for them.
Fat fuck, lardbeast, lardball, lardo, and the rest are variations of their own name, e.g. patricia=fatricia and e.g. patrick=fatrick
Plus, until you have been with an athlete, you don't really know how good it is.With 70% of people being overweight the chances of being thus experienced are minimal. So in order to feel better, fee fee lies are created.
Yeah they'll eat it again around 11-12 as a "midnight snack" before passing out with 2k calories in their stomach.
Well done, I actually let out a little shriek.
People with those diseases are NOT what makes up the vast majority of obese adults and children, especially in the USA. It's a bald-faced lie to say gluttony isn't the main cause by far.
If six inches of his dick is visible at 320 lbs, I wouldn't be surprised if there was a good two to three inches concealed by his fupa. Thin privelage is being able to find your whole cock.
So weird, one of the first things I googled was "is it okay if I work out without makeup?" because the standard in my gym seems to be, that you are supposed to wear a ton of makeup. I feel like a homeless person around the fit chicks in barely any clothes and lots of makeup :/ I only apply eyeliner if I do upperbody. If I get a good workout my arms are shaky for a good while afterwards and I am just not good enough to draw a straight line with that. (I go to the gym before work)But normally I don't use anything in the gym. I have neurodermatitis and well.. sweat and foundation doesn't go so well together for me. And after lifting a bit my skincolor gets the color of my irritated skin, so I think I am not offending anyone with looking funny.. (I hope).But in my gym its more common to wear a lot than not wearing any makeup at all.. weird.
It's shellless Zoidberg.
...then what...?
take a gamble /r/FiftyFifty
I know disabled people who do sports..
I love Golden Corral. It's a great company, owned by fantastic people, that is based in North Carolina. They do great things for the military, and with things like their "bottomless chocolate fountain" and the new "cotton candy stations", they are hastening fatties into the grave.Going to Golden Corral is my guilty pleasure. It's a decent way to eat a massive amount of protein while playing "spot the next chair to collapse" I wish I could franchise a Golden Corral. I'd have "FREE BUFFET" nights, but I'd make all the doors to the restaurant super narrow. It's like a bird-feeder with a squirrel-trap.
I guess the selfish stick is the only way they can fit their body in 1 picture
^She's ^not ^21! ^SHHHHH!
omg I never realized just how big she is until the side by side comparison. WOW!
Ok. I'll take this to mean it was 'fat hatey' enough.
Someone should charge her with child abuse.
Or you could braise it in a tomato sauce and make osso bucco.
Yeah someone should definitely have her retconned
"Just because I don't look like a twig doesn't mean I can't be beautiful" is the mentality. They're trying to get us to focus on something else.
it's as big a circlejerk as this sub. But at least this sub was created for that purpose.I can't discuss any politics in /r/Canada that stray slightly from the anti-Harper agenda the sub boasts without getting flamed on.
sadly I'm more of a pear than an hourglass (not a ham planet pear with thunder thighs and a bag full of cottage cheese for an ass) I just have a narrow ribcage and bigger hips. I don't have that much of a waist but what is there id rather show off, or at least not have to wear long baggy shirts all the time because even if something fitted did hit my waist, it would be a crop
sorry. you know what i meant
Talk about sour grapes. This kind of reminds me of that test one lady did on a dating site wherein she responded to guys telling her, "you're cute", "you're hot", "i think you're pretty", etc. with an "I know." She didn't even refuse their advances or anything, just accepted them in a way that I suppose you could consider arrogant, and then these men who were being nice to her all of a sudden started saying, "you're not that hot, don't flatter yourself". It's best we all stay aware of those who have deep-seated insecurities with themselves and have to bring others down to their level to feel "normal".
Followed. I'm Gurl.interrupted :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: Debating if I want to hashtag my last pic lol
The worst part is that every dating site has about a dozen ways of just saying "fat" but they still have to hijack those words. A few extra pounds, heavyset, stocky, full figured, big. It all means the same thing and none of those words were good enough for them (because then they have to admit to being fat.)
Well, they had to get a picture with the Grand Canyon...on her chest.
What if you wrap the cock in bacon first?
Disposable adipose tissue*Fify
I thought she had big tits? I mean how many fucking times did she mention them in that "article" (I use the term loosely).She's just a sad sack of shit as far as I can tell.
Go for it, don't let obeasts put you off some delicious cheese bread.
She can't reach them
Ladies and gentlemen! I present to you; the world's most Beta male!
What a fucking pig. Most hams I just want them to lose weight, but I really hope she dies and I hope it's related to her weight.
It's called cow tipping.
&gt; When they say 30 stone wtf measurement is that.Europe!A stone is 14 pounds, or 6.3kg.So me? I weight 10.5 stones, which corresponds to 147lb in real units, or 66kg if you want to be all new-fangled!
"You don't understand how deep my struggles are!"
So where do I go to get my free buzz cut and swastika? I've already got blue eyes, so that parts fine.
It's 30 degrees. ...F where I'm from.
Except planet fitness some of the most judgmental people in the "fitness" industry. There are some cases where they have actually banned members for "being too fit/healthy" as they say it "intimidates" others. Whereas other gyms no one cares how fat/out of shape you are so long as you're not doing something completely stupid (like using equipment with terrible form without asking a member of staff to show you how to use it)
Yeah, my hunch is a side view would show a lot of abdominal fat, which is the sign of a body in breakdown.
I feel sorry for Finland, poor Finnish people dealing with a fatty that repulsive.
He probably never changed his diet after he stopped exercising, I've seen it happen too
Where the fuck you find these pictures jesus christ I couldnt even imagine such a strange caricature.
I personally view the down votes as a positive sign that the message got through to some HAES land whale. Every down vote makes my smile a little brighter.
&gt;I routinely get to have experiences on this amazing planet that you could never even dream of.Like jumping.
Going to a funeral is like dropping your donut in the toilet.
You know your a gigantic lard when you body starts storing fat in your fingers.
Fuck that. I'm not paying taxes so some "just think of the rabbits, Lennie" wannabe can buy some fancy gun to but a bullet in the back of someone's neck.I don't even believe in socialised law enforcement. It's my money and I'm not the fuck-tard who 1) gave up on their Karate lessons or 2) chose to walk through that back alley.
I use a Garmin, but just look on Amazon.

So did that dog gain all the weight back after being put into "starvation mode" or what?
Wtf is with the 55 pages of toys, garbage food, garbage candy toys and clothes they could never, ever fit in? Jesus the entitlement. But I guess they really are just mentally fucked i.e 'my heart is fiiiiine'. Total insanity.
You can feel the brain cells this poor man is losing trying to be rational with this whale.
Also, never letting her teeth touch.It's a trick that a lot of models use where they will have their mouth "open" but their lips will be closed- this makes it look like you have thinner cheeks and a longer face.So she always has this gormless look on her face.
He's not in here to hate, he's in here to fap to dembighips.
Makes sense, but why are the measurements of the seat so huge that these colossal beings can actually ride in them? I mean old people aren't so fat in general.
I'm sure :D But you have to admit, it hits so many of the stereotype points that it sounds fake.
Don't hams just eat with their ham hands?
60% of morbidly obese are women.
Actually, her shoe size is 11 - pretty big. They're just shall in comparison to get body.
It is true when you go out to eat. All the healthy options are usually more expensive than the shit options, but as someone says even if they did make it cheaper every if any kids would chose the salad over the burger. They need to change the way of thinking
Made me rage . 10/10
265lb is Lesnar's fight weight due to weight class, he's probably much heavier in normal day to day, but yes, Tess Munster is fucking fat hamplanet.
OP, throw this up on /r/photoshopbattles and see if anyone wants to make this even better.
Stuff like this makes me so excited for summer. I can't wait to see all the hot shitladys and shitlords proving that bodies like this are completely attainable and not retouched. Seeing a tumblrina ham jealously gawk at a fit person is the best. It ALMOST makes up for the fatkini she will most likely be wearing.
Ah, so a 14 might be an 8 or some such. Okay. Thank you :)
I read through your convo and it's not so much he had an addiction. He's cheating on you. With food. He isn't hooked on something and sneaks off to get a fix because he needs it. He does it because it feels good and makes him feel in control. Seriously, instead of replacing "gorging" with something like shooting up heroin, think about it as him fucking another woman. You're so devoted to him, but he goes on a business trip and you could see in his face he ate too much? That is literally like you smelling another woman on his dick. He fetishizes food so much he probably orders takeout on business trips like someone else would order a hooker.
Context: She was pretending to be one of the cartoon ponies (high pitched voice and everything). However, I wouldn't be surprised if she actually didn't know what diabetes is.
It's even funnier when they use depression as an excuse because going to gym/performing physical activities (even a simple 30 min walk) is proven to reduce the symptoms and effects of depression, both in the short term and long term..."Involvement in structured exercise has shown promise in alleviating symptoms of clinical depression. Since the early 1900s, researchers have been interested in the association between exercise and depression""Many studies have examined the efficacy of exercise to reduce symptoms of depression, and the overwhelming majority of these studies have described a positive benefit associated with exercise involvement""Research also suggests that the benefits of exercise involvement may be long lasting. Depressed adults who took part in a fitness program displayed significantly greater improvements in depression, anxiety, and self-concept than those in a control group after 12 weeks of training""Exercise is effective for both men and women of all ages as well as those who are initially more severely depressed. Further, comparison of exercise program characteristics across the studies yielded nonsignificant ESs, indicating that exercise need not be lengthy or intense"[Source link (US National Library of Medicine), which includes all references as it's not just some tumblr blog with made up shit and is actually based upon studies and this thing called research and science](URLSorry for wall of text my fellow shitlords.
A "different kind of sin"? Haha, for being so devout to her religion, she clearly didn't read the part why it says all sin is the same in the Lord's eyes save ONE.
For people with mood disorders like depression or bipolar, staying fit actually contributes a great deal to staying sane.
[Wat](URLThis is a new level of irony.
Dude... Just... Dude...
The bike part alone would kill her. Her ass would swallow the seat and she'd quit then due to her bike 'malfunctioning'.
I just said "What the fuck?" out loud. That amorphous blob of human waste is the most disgusting thing I've seen. *Subscribed*
Are you talking about the r/askreddit thread titled "Reddit, what do you look like?"?
I could never guess this was Rinoa Heartilly without her saying so. FF8 was one of my favorite games too, fuck you you fat fuck for ruining its memory.
Could it be from sitting all the time? I have no idea if thats possible.
&gt;a single motherSo you're saying there's achance.
I'm jealous of her thighs o.o
This is perfect. FPH is converting all of reddit.
I recognize that bomb testing!
&gt; I rarely ever see racist/homophobic/otherwise hateful comments in the positives here.I love this about FPH. Every comment that starts to lean towards hating something besides fat people is quickly called out in a nice, courteous way. We always shut that shit down so we can focus all our hate on the fats.
I'm on the fourth floor with no stairs. A fatty could trip and roll downstairs into a basement. They'll never get in here :-)
She's in her sock feet to boot.
Only **a** fine for anyone who has to interact with this...lard part.
Like rhino in Spider-Man 2
This happened to two throwaway accounts I had. I responded that I was trying to have a positive, science based argument with a group of people advocating self harm. I've yet to get a response back.
This "parent" should be executed! Making a decision to let yourself go is horrible enough but to encourage pizza bonding moments causing your children to be ridiculed and laughed at their entire lives is beyond simply bad judgment. Will you warm with parental delight when your waddling daughter looses her first foot to diabetes? Fat fucks should never be parents and pass on their idiocy to their spawn.

Are you using Chrome by any chance? In my experience the Unity Web Player doesn't work on Chrome. I used Safari and it worked just fine. Hope this helps! :)
Cuntdishuns, cuntaminating the gene pool, cuntinuing to shorten their lives, fat cunts.
Something i can definitely relate. I work at a tommy hilfiger store. I consider myself to be a fashionable guy. In fact, i love fashion. Now we do sell nice clothes but its an outlet so its always on sale. When we change seasons, obviously the previous one goes on sale. So we have those sections for sales and a sales rack. The rack is 99% xs, s, m. Everywhere else, piles are always 3 quarter xs,s,m and 1/4 big sizes because everyone is so fat and thats all we ever sell. Tommy might be nice, but its never nice on fat people. Nice clothes are never meant for fatties, just look at models. Yah one might say "models have unrealistic body sizes" and that might be true to some extent, but fatness itself is unrealistic and unnatural! If fat was a normality, we would never have survived evolution.
Is a fat joke really that shitty though? Just curious seeing the kind of mods you have over in your totes not racist sub.
I mean, you don't have to. Who cares what they think? They're nasty. They just give you shit because they know they'll never have a chance with you and they want to feel better about themselves.
It makes me mad to see hot pieces of ass like this get fat.
Wait. I thought POC had *no privilege*. I can't keep up with all this SJW stuff!
better not look out the window then, seeing someone jogging might ~really trigger~
Trust me, they get a lot worse than that.
Warning fat sympathy
To each their own! I live in a loft with limited space so I try to keep my belongings down.
I'm a dude but I really wanna wear that
Ugh. Seeing the elderly lady would have broken my heart. I would have asked her for a list and gathered her stuff for her if I were there. She's old man, she can't help that. Fat people suck.
I understand that I just thought as long as I was bashing fatties everything was alright...sorry i truly love this sub has me constantly laughing
Blonde is a bombshell, wow
Hah, was she trying to do some kind of Jedi mind trick on you? "You are attracted to me! This is the fat you are looking for!"
Why is this front page?Edit: some touchy fuckers in here lol
I'd answer but we were told to be extra careful about doxxing
Preach it sister!
Her ribs would show? Pahah what the fuck, I usually weigh (when not all pregant'd up) half her weight and I'm the same height.My ribs don't show.Now what kind of fucked up ribs has got?
Dat fucking everything. Why be picky?
They're chubby? Yes, and the sun is warm, Anarctica is cool, and shitlords are uncomfortable with fatties.
I believe the average waist size for a woman in the fifties was 24 inches. Yeah. Pretty fucking different.Edit: In addition, Monroe was a around 22 inches in photos like these, which was 2 inches smaller than average. Her weight fluctuated, but we all know she was considered her sexiest around this size. Fat women have never been sexy. The mental gymnastics one has to go through to insist otherwise amazes me.
I doubt we could find a chain strong enough to hold the obeast off the ground once we get the hook in it.
yeah, this sub has a strange hostility towards any disagreement.
Yes!! But that article is 3 years old and somehow it sure seems like the number of obese should be a lot higher than 34%... I see them everywhere!
Warning for finding something about a fatty attractive.
Most obvious troll ever.
It is a shame that in his position of power and opportunity he was able to drop all that weight only to put it back on. Why is he still relevant?
We hate fat people who take up our space and smell like shit because they can't reach their asshole and cost us money because they can't go to work but still need medication for their condishuns and try to shove down our throats that they're beautiful while being fit is not. I don't think this girl is currently doing any of those things. Fuck her for letting herself get as far as she has, but I don't have the energy to straight up hate everyone who's like her.
But mah fee fees. I can't help muh guhnetics.
Beth Ditto introduced me to shitlording. When I was younger I met my shitlord cousins. Fit, pretty girls who would talk about fatties all the time. Id never even heard someone talk about how someone was fat and gross, before they started talking about Beth.
Wait, I don't get it, how can he look like that being 235 lbs? Even then he looked more like 300 lbs.
Can't the gems choose what they look like?why must amethyst be fat?
shit... fooled me. All I see is thinspo holding up a sign!
My mom has hypothyroidism. She weighs like, a buck ten.It does make you feel tired. Maybe my 1 case isn't definitive but I'd have to assume that it doesn't so much "cause weight gain" as it "causes fatties to sit around and eat too much because they feel tired."
The editing on the thigh on the left is really obvious and doesn't look very professional
She used to be hot, but she's running out of places to attach or inject silicone into.
Feminist my ass! These narcissistic bitches hate every woman around them.
All sorts of women ( especially celebrities) use contouring makeup for all sorts of reasons ( cheekbones cleavage etc) ... What I want to know is why wasn't she highlighting her collarbones ? Instead of following the natural shape she did this awkward v shape that's just weird looking ...
Typical fatty, their only talent is taking good photos of food (the only thing they love), incidentally your meal looks delicious.
"Model" I think she might be the one just calling herself that.
*Reddit is infested with men who are taller than 5'9"
I'm just starting it as well. The key seems to be good form. I tweaked my back kind of badly when trying my first barbell row. Watch all the videos and record your own form if possible to see how you're doing

Of course they're trying to sell product. But it is also making the world a better place if it points a spotlight at an unhealthy message and fosters ridicule, and if it makes those who hold a healthy position more confident that they can advocate that position as well.
It's clearly the difference between Miller lite and Coors light. These pictures make it clear as day.
It's funny how he keeps commenting on his own picture when nobody else does
Ehh I exclusively date crazy girls and they are kinda all over the place in terms of tightness. Two of the average sized ones were pretty tight and the thinnest was like an opera theater with a hotdog in the center. So I don't think it's related :\
Commercial farming is bad, but what is the alternative? If we all hunted wild game it would wreck the ecology of the planet just too much. I think eventually we can make meat farming far more humane, we just don't have a better solution right now and we will have to face the wrath of our grandchildren when that time comes and they look back on our practices with contempt and rage.
what a disgusting monster.
Hey whatever works! :D
To me, (as a white North American), Japanese girls tend to look much younger than they are. I still can't believe the girls in Babymetal are 15 and 16. They look 9-12 to me.
Prove that you are worthy!
As a nerdy woman, let me just say THIS. The best thing you can do for yourself is to get out of your shell and get the confidence to approach these women in real life. You will not come off as a cocky douche if that's not in your makeup, so don't worry about that. Bookstores and coffeeshops - I used to LIVE in them and would totally talk to any guy in those places. That much said, if you are going to do any online dating, pay the $$ and either do a premium service or hire a real dating service that screens people. You get what you pay for when it comes to that. If I were single again, I would use an actual service that would help me find the kind of man I'd want to date.
Shucks! The butterbeast ate all the butter; we'll just have plain popcorn.
Actually the pic wasn't in the screen shot from my phone. I would have had to take two screen shots and make an imgur album which would have been more work.
Ok, we're done here everyone can go home.
Oh fuck, a gay flag! No! No! No! Nothing gay there.
It amuses me that one of her pictures is of herself reaching inside her voluminous drawers, yet she says she doesn't send nudes. I call BS.
That a 2 person seat or 3?
I have a very rational fear of fatties when I'm on planes.
I was kind of late to the party on the KSTV funding, will they be available for all to watch or have I missed out?
Shush you, keep wearing them, they're hella cute, and I bet they look adorable on you. She just looks like a bad joke.
This made me laugh so hard.Finally we found a use for them though.
Taylor Swift-ly running to Krispy Kreme.
If that doesn't include 'torso' I'm confused. Because her torso is way too big as well.
Boogie is a pathetic sack of shit and I genuinely can't wait until he's dead.
Ahhhh I actually own one of the jackets she's wearing. Or something extremely similar. The flower blazer? Do I have to burn it now?
BF% is a more accurate tool for measuring healthy weight, but BMI is easier and a lot of people just don't know their BF%.

Didn't I kill those in dead space?
Well, its pretty easy. Hate the hambeasts and dont fall pray to fat logic and most importantly dont be fat yourself.
That would be horrific.
I know, that sweater is just *awful*.
Wow - wee. That's just...wow.
I think it might be the only place in the mall with enough open space for them to congregate in.
I wouldnt be opposed to a plague that affected the hambeasts....I would lose some relatives but it would be a small price to pay.
ugh you're so lucky. iv just started a module 'the body in contemporary life' taught by a fat white female. im only in the first week and shes already spoke about the 'oppression' and bullying fat people go through. this is not going to be fun for either of us.
I'm having trouble imagining how one either buries or cremates such a large body.
I do that every single time. I buzz the flight attendant, all fake-concerned, and say that this "lady" or "gentleman" (terms used loosely) can't possibly be comfortable, and can you maybe move her/him to first class or to a more comfortable seat? Yeah, I get a dirty look from the ham, but once she/he is moved, I have two seats to myself.
also removed all the benches.
Oh god you're triggering me.
Holy shit. When the page loaded, I was forced to watch a Pepto ad that began "We've got trouble in tummy (tubby?) town..." anyone else? There was a hambeast who had eaten too much pizza. Pepto. That is the solution.
My wife and I watch it too, I don't think we really intend to, but once the channel hits TLC we just can't stop watching. My wife actually knows of this doctor too, working in the healthcare field in Houston. I say she "knows of" him because she works for a respectable institution, she's talked to some coworkers about the show before and the general consensus is that he's not too well thought of in the medical community.
She doesn't realize it, but every diet worked for her. Even if she was gaining weight on that particular diet, she was gaining less than she would have gained otherwise. Most of these people are on a weight-gain escalator. Their normal eating habits result in constant steady weight gain. Dieting might reverse the process for a while, or at least slow it down, but once they go back to their old eating habits, they're back on the escalator, headed for ever greater mass.
It was gummy with red corn syrup, though, which is... Just as bad.
No, no. Magic the Gathering is pretty damn bad. And of course most of the time if I enter a shop I'm the only female and instantly fedora'd to death
What? Since when did supporting gay marriage make you an SJW?
&gt; Sheila-na-gigI can't... stop laughing. Oh god, that erm. Black hole.
I wanna see this show. For uh...*ahem* research. Where can I view it?
When she look up after sucking
Oh my god...those videos.....hahahahaha I needed that laugh. This is a seriously underrated post.
Check this one out lol URL
That arm has at least 3000 kilojoules of stored energy. Too bad her body can't use it lol.
i like the "canadadianmodel" hashtag

Im actually kinda sad i never meet people like that in real life. I would just walk up to them and ask if they are 100% sure to be "fit" - and if they are - lets test their proclaimed "fitness". Nothing huge - just some basics. 3km run or a 20km ride on my bike? Oh; what was that? Cardio is no your thing - that sucks! But no problem! Lets do some body weight exercises. 20 push-ups or 5 dead hang chin ups no biggie right?Listening to their excuses would be so much fun!
SO BRAVE AND BEAUTIFUL
To make an attempt at something even when obviously out-ranked and out-classed. Like boxing in a weight class above your own. Simply put, league nonsense.
I think you meant that question as a joke, but in case you didn't, it's a pharmacy inside a grocery store. Perfect combo for fatties needing to address their cundishuns while shopping for more beetus food. (Notice their cart is full of toilet paper and more beetus juice).
upvoted for using something from the original 3 seasons!
It really does. It's crazy how much better I feel after just losing the ~20 pounds of flab I gained on my last bulk cycle. I really think I'm going to have to go with some form of leangains because even just gaining 20-30 pounds (I'm ripped at 230, so 30 isn't that much for me) makes me feel awful.In some ways I can see why the hams are so cranky all the time. If I felt bad with just 30 extra they must feel absolutely terrible. That's what really grinds my gears about how 95% of diet(er)s fail. 95% of these people lost weight but decided "nope, even though I look and feel better I'd still rather eat an entire box of Oreos in one sitting."
Me. I want to become Sam Hyde's understudy so I need to know everything I can about him.
This was my reaction when I saw this picture: URL
I'll take that as a compliment! (:
Thar she blows! Man the harpoons!
Seats in public transportation.
second one sounds more practical; in my view, fast food restaurants should have a legal obligation to refuse service to hambeasts, in much the way that pub and bar staff are obliged to refuse service to very drunk peopleonly problem with that is, every single fast food restaurant in the nation would need to hire an army of security guards armed with truncheons and tazers, just to keep the inevitable fatwrath under control
Nope! She is a senior in college. I'm unfortunately an alumna of the same sorority as her :crying_face: Our poor chapter has gone downhill so much.
We must enjoy it while it lasts my fellow countrymen. I forsee fatties on scooters in our near future.
It looks like a pimple when you decide to squeeze it open... o.o
It was shadow banned by the mods. But it proves you never actually read it did you. Click my name and view my comments. It is there with -16 or votes. I wouldn't expect anyone from this sub to have any brains. Come on a Fat Hating sub that doesn't like to talk about exercise. That is fucking hilarious.
Came here to say the same thing. It started with thin women who wanted to make their Breast look bigger, now the fatties stole it and made it something different. You know, how they do with everything.
"and roll around till they starve to death."Silly! The would go into 'starvation mode' and actually GAIN weight!Don't you know nuttin?
I have a friend with legitimate anorexia who had to spend a week in the hospital because his heart slowed down. And here fatties are, saying that it's something they can just "try out". This makes me mad.
I just ate some chicken nuggets, so I'm sure I'm closer to 150 right now. Also, 'chicken nuggets'. Yeah. I'm a fat ass.
No one is making fun of rape, we're making fun of fatties.

Even after I opened it, I stared at it with an open mouthed look of disgust for several moments, trying to figure out what I was looking at. Still only 90% sure.
I work at McDonalds, and when I'm bored, I read the nutritional information. The sweet tea has exactly three times the sugar that Sprite has. Whenever I feel like sweet tea, I fill the cup almost to the top with unsweetened, then add about a half inch or so of sweet.
That's not nice, he obviously has Down syndrome.
She looks like she wants to eat him. That doesn't look cute at all.

I hate to be the dissenting voice here. I do statistical shape analysis (especially the head and face) and image processing, and although I'm remarkably hung over and know little about their algorithm here, it is likely skewed by two factors: the drastic makeup which would make identifying salient landmarks difficult, and Tessbeast would probably be a big (lol) outlier compared to their training set. That being said, she definitely fools the heuristic for age identification in my own brain, which probably fares better than this automated approach on average.
She looks like a spade.
Personally I believe what OPs mother did is the wrong course of action for a young woman. However, scaring them by showing them possible/likely deleterious affects of overeating would work better.The kid doesn't hate you and they learn something.
I am so sick of it. Them and their blubber standards. Fuck straight people, cis-het males, etc.Also white people. What the hell?You preach that you want respect, but you throw anyone against you under the bus and talk shit any chance you get. You can't get what you don't give out.
Daaang. I'm at 0.68, and I don't know if I can get it any better than that. Any tips?

So many of these absurdities post out to low IQ in most hambeasts
We obviously have some double standard motherfuckers here. Same with the hypocritical haters who think fat retards or queers are "fine"The downvotes prove it
Are you triggered?
I need to get a picture of it and post it. I didn't see it until it was too late but in Indiana I literally passed two bill boards that are almost right next to each other. (both easily pictured together) The first one is an IHOP Bill board with a mountain of pancakes. The next? A crushed up cigarette with text about with millions of deaths a year.
I watched that like 2 hours ago. My first thought when I saw her body was "that's not a shape, I don't understand"
Tammy is currently on life support, so we'll see. This is like celebrity gossip. Lol I feel so silly for knowing about it.
Ah, this was 2 years ago, SRS lost their shit over it
Those stretch marks. Lady, your skin is trying to tell you something!
... Or die
"D'uh oh. There's one of those guys I want but could never get! Must reject him first and pretend like he's beneath me!!"This blubber-faced bitch would eat her left ham-tit if it meant being with this guy.
The more muscle mass and bigger bones thing made me smirk. And she is supposed to be certified nutritionist. Really...
And I am glad that they don't live that long.
The grossest part of these fatty pics to me is when they hold up their guts with pride, like wtf? WHY?
That occurred to me too, what with the red eyes.
This is why society is turning to shit
I salute you for making it to the end of this album. I gave up after two pics and the incredible urge I had to go and vomit. Strong stomach. I bet you can handle roller coasters like they were kiddie rides.
Hahah. Yes. I wish more business people were honest about fat people hurting their business

Agreed on all points. It did make me think about cosplaying...I wanted to get into it but I was so fucking fat at the time.
At least, the trench doesn't smell
Gender: KILL IT WITH FIRE
"Curvy" is a very specific body type. Bust and hip are close to the same circumference, and the waist is 8-12" smaller depending on height. It's so simple. But thanks to fatties as soon as you have one protruding body part BOOM you're an hourglass. Fuck you, society.

The fact that fat women think they automatically have a chance with black men is proof enough that white privilege is a thing.
They live to eat.
It's like saying Penis in shock with a southern drawl. As in, "I wonder what we'll find when we lift this...OH GAWD, A PANNUS!"
I'm at about 60% on this, but I'm gonna say it's got a vagina somewhere in there.
We don't have one of those in my town :( Our liquor stores are the pharmacies though...CVS and Rite-aid...
I wouldn't be surprised if when he gets headaches from caffeine withdrawal, or becomes anxious or irritable because he can't get his caffeine fix, he just inhales something sugary. It's easy to convince yourself you're breaking a habit when you're really just swapping one addiction for another.

With logic like that, a skinny woman like me can't argue.
It's not hallucinogens, it's just pure desperation. They can't process what they have become so lie to themselves.
My grand Irish liver has cheated me out of this. Even at 85 pounds, I can do ten shots plus wine in one night. I do this a couple of times per year, and I don't drink regularly but those hangovers are terrible. The older I get the worse the hangover. In addition, I'm either sober or blackout drunk. There's no in between stage for me for some reason.
Not on their side *at all* but, in Europe it is somewhat common for women to not wear tops at the beach. Europe is great in many ways.
I can't reveal trade secrets, but the thing is that we can't measure how often people browse FPH, so the only measure we have is how often they participate.
Jesus Christ. Look, if your idea of a good time is watching your wife fuck other dudes, then go for it. If you want to be a swinger and have an 'open relationship' and explore your sexuality, be my guest. But, these insane double standards feminists are proposing are fucking retarded. Typical "For me but not for thee!" thinking. Of course, if a man suggested that it's sexist for his wife to not allow him to fuck other women, these fembots would have steam coming out of their ears. The modern day feminist movement is such a fucking joke.
Who's that?
she literally has manatee level fat
Are you for real? This is just silly.
When are fatties just gonna accept the fact that the majority of men rather jump off a bridge than settle with a lardo woman? I'm single at the moment, coming out of a long term relationship, I haven't even started looking for another woman yet, but I'll be fucking damned if I settle for someone. I'd rather be alone and single forever than be with a lazy fattie. I have respect for myself, and my image. I have friends and coworkers who have fat wives/gs, I don't know how they stay together. I'd be embarrassed as fuck.
C-concrete enema? Really?

This is just proof that food is an addiction to them. To even consider this bein okay is just mentally ill. I used to be addicted to meth and once I ran to get a sack with no shoes on because I was just focused on picking up. I legit forgot to brush my hair too. That's what this picture reminds me of. She just wants her fix of fat ass greasy shit being crammed down her face tube. Shameful.
I see the pink towel covers the two girls most import asset - the fupa!
I came here to me a similar observation.
I've been feeling crappy about my perpetual singleness today, but this cheered me right up. Being single is way better than dating that amorphous hog. Thanks fph, you always make my day!
Wow. You just one upped me, and I'm terrified.
Those are things I am aware of, and I buy chick boxers because comfortable. And I feel like a peephole is pretty self explanatory. Also, what do you mean by "details"? I've been looking for cuter panties.
Were you bullied for something within your control though, like being fat? Or something like your race, or sexuality?

Oh I agree, I've seen enough misinformation online to know that people will believe all kinds of wrong things when it comes to diet and fitness. I think that's why teaching basic nutrition and healthy eating at schools would be a great idea :)

This sub is the only one I really check anymore apart from sometimes browsing /r/all. Here it's not about the karma, it's not about sjws, it's not about all the other bs that seems to occur in other subreddits. We hate fat people. It's how we do. The end!
Kick 'em out!

It's pretty obvious to see what activity someone is built for just by looking at them. You see some hulking dude with big muscles you assume he's built to lift things. You see a skinny guy in athletic shoes and assume he runs or bikes or something. If I see someone with a belly wider than their shoulders and flabby T Rex arms I'm going to assume they're built to eat and sit. The powers of observation

What are those weight benches? Looks like a weird combo of a bench and one of those As Seen On TV Ab Rollup things.God I hate people on their cellphones in the gym. Using it for music or to keep track of reps etc is cool, but people mostly use them to play games and text and watch videos while biking at zero resistance at a slow, pointless pace.
One is a whale, the other is wearing a scalloped top. There's a right amount of the beach to put on your body people.

RAPE SEED NUCLEAR BLAST
4500 of healthy food is so much that it seems really impossible. Fatties who eat shit food, on the other hand, do it with a bunch of sugary, fat-laden bullshit.E.g., let's say fat ass Munster has one of those Beetusbucks nightmares in the AM and then gets a Sonic shake at 9pm for evening snack^teehee.That's 2500+ calories just in "drinks". If you're used to eating like a hog, you can wolf down a large BeetusBucks and a Sonic Shake and not think much of it.
Exactly. If you don't hate everything that fat represents, you risk becoming Fatty McGee.
What is there to hate? She's smiling, smiling because you will never be as fat or plug fugly as her.
The belly ~~button~~ cave and ~~dimples~~ craters in her side form a face that is not happy.

The gut bothers me. Stretch marks are an unavoidable part of expanding abdominal tissue. Some are worse than others but damn, get rid of the gut.
At least they are comparing to something plausibly achievable for them. Most of the time FA logic compares to fashion model extremes as justification for giving up. That is not possible, so why try?

I posted this in another thread, but it belongs here too...cute - Crazy, Ugly, Tubblr Elephant.
I'm surprised it's not being mentioned much, but Tesla was pretty much insane.&gt;I had a violent aversion against the earrings of women but other ornaments, as bracelets, pleased me more or less according to design. The sight of a pearl would almost give me a fit but I was fascinated with the glitter of crystals or objects with sharp edges and plane surfaces. I would not touch the hair of other people except, perhaps, at the point of a revolver. I would get a fever by looking at a peach and if a piece of camphor was anywhere in the house it caused me the keenest discomfort. Even now I am not insensible to some of these upsetting impulses. When I drop little squares of paper in a dish filled with liquid, I always sense a peculiar and awful taste in my mouth. I counted the steps in my walks and calculated the cubical contents of soup plates, coffee cups and pieces of food - otherwise my meal was unenjoyable.Not to say this particular aversion doesn't make sense, but the man brings a new meaning to "out of his mind". The above is only a tiny sliver of his insanity, which he expresses with extraordinary clarity in his autobiography, "My Inventions". Crazy read.Edit: [Here's](URL
It has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness though. It's certainly something to be emphasized, but overeating needs to be too.

Also lets not mention that my pale skin is completely different than her self inflicted obesity that can easily be reversed.

It's becoming the male equivalent of the term 'curvy'. My dad just turned sixty and could probably outrun me. I think it's incredibly disrespectful to all the dads who take pride in their bodies and work hard to stay healthy. So settle for chubby guys if that's your thing, but don't call them dadbods.
Ugh you have no idea. I have a coworker that's massive. He almost lost his leg last year to diabetes. He's so disgusting and we have about 6 chairs that are all stained like this because he would move around and sit in them throughout the year. When we finally got new ones management brought him a special plastic chair that he has to clean after every shift otherwise he gets written up and will eventually get fired, and he's not allowed to sit in the new chairs
Pretty much. The fat does need a blood supply so you need make sure the bleeding has stopped before you staple up the hole.

I didn't think I posted enough either... But once a day for a week... Does that mean if I commented 7 times in one day that would be enough?
Even they have a regulated diet... I guess you could call that "brain-dead privilege"......oh you mean the food. Those too.
So no, I'm not a shitlord. I'm neither attacked by fat people nor in a position to embrace attacking fat people.
Cavemen did, but I´m not a a caveman. And greasebeasts probably don´t want one either.

Feeders are the lowest of the low. Not just encouraging fat, but so insecure they have to contribute to ruining someone else's life so they know they can't leave them. I hope every one of them gets rolled over on and suffocated in a fat roll.
Is she a normal sized person yet?
It looks shopped to me too. You get a puffyness on the upper eyelids when you gain that much, she just has a goiter look to her face. The eyes are the same. The shadowing around her figure is iffy looking too.

They won't. The only bite they feel is themselves biting doughnuts.
I dated a girl who had eating disorder problems, and said that this was actually a helpful exercise. However, she's tiny. They are not.
This reminds me of the time a fatass kid kicked my puppy. At the time she was about 12 weeks. My pup is a corgi. I was taking her out for a walk and a potty around my apartment and saw a lardass mom and her tubby two year old sitting outside of my complex. My pup just loves people and she hadn't had a chance to meet any kids yet so I thought it would be a good socialization moment. I asked the mom if her kid wouldn't mind meeting my dog. She said no problem. I walked my pup about halfway toward the kid and let the kid come the rest of the way. The kid walks right up to my pup and kicks her in the face. I am absolutely shocked and horrified that my 12 week puppy has just been kicked for doing jack shit. The mom responds, "Oh don't worry about it. He does that to our dog all the time." Like that made it ok.Fucking hambeasts have no respect for anything. Not for other people. Not for their animals. And definitely not for themselves.
&gt;Most of the genetic diversity is within races.This. A certain amount of diversity among members of an "in-group" is healthy and necessary - and this is what the OP in the pic is trying to allude to but fails. It's all about the scope of the definition of *diversity*. Diversity among in-group members is good, diversity as in in-group and out-group members mixing is bad.
You were never thirsty enough. After a brisk, morning jog, the best-tasting thing in the world would be water. Fuck coffee. There, I said it. Now the java gods shall rage.
It's literally the Kama Fupa
That first girl. I'm in love.
I often wonder with these types of moms what they think good nutrition for their children looks like. Getting a child to eat a healthy meal is hard enough(I can't tell you the dinnertime battles we've had in my house lately), and feeding them junk regularly makes that harder because they get conditioned to the fat, salt, and sugar. Do they just not care? I mean, they must not, but then it can be inferred that they are abusing their children by being neglectful. That's a logical inference. It pisses me off so much.
I think that dude is on the menu
Oh my god, I think I've realized what the dress is supposed to be! I think it's supposed to be ice &amp; fire, with one side representing Edward and the other side representing Jacob (if you look closely, you can see red lights on the other side, and I would bet anything there is a big Jacob head there.This is the saddest, tackiest thing I have ever seen.
Just tell them you eat a ton but can't put on weight regardless of what you do. Blame it on your genetics. Watch their jealousy grow as they turn into landwhales.
And this children is what we call a *gasp* Tumblrian! Look how it embodies the spirit of sticking it to the sexist pigs we call MEN!
A beast of this magnitude does not die like this. You must target its weak point, the feefees. Or just wait for a massive heart attack to take it.
Carving on aspen trees... Grrrrrr. Stupid fat cunt, I should carve the rules of the forest into her fat ass
Okay, I think I've got your point now. It was literally me overthinking the emphasis of "not" and "shouldn't" and such.And yeah there are exceptions for sure, but I've personally never encountered a fat girl whose interests extend beyond their tummy, unrealistic expectations, and Netflix, or fat guys who have interests beyond CoD and WoW. It's a sickness, and it's weird as fuck.I'm just glad that it makes those of us with actual interests and lives stand out a bit more.
And such a childishly threatening comment. "You better do what I want, or I'll downvote you". These people don't *ever* consider that they have a problem, do they? It's always the world's fault.
Pretty much a half-assed, I-AM-VERY-SMART, rip-off of something Loki said to Black Widow in the avengers.

For non Americans, 16 oz is an American pint, just under 500ml.That's a large serving as well in the UK, and about 200 calories.If 8 oz is 100 calories, then most of these fatties must be getting at least 2,000 calories just from drinks (160 oz or 2.4 liters)....and they probably try to delude themselves into thinking drinks have no calories.

&gt; Her height: 5'2"Ok, that explains it, then. I'm half asleep and for a moment I was floundering over the size 12 thing. "But I'm NOT fat and I'm size 10-12, what gives!?" Then I remembered I'm 5'7 and BMI 23 and have childbearing hips.Seriously, HOW can someone be 170+ and only 5'2? I mean yeah, I know how, but the idea of waddling around with all that extra unhealthy lard just staggers my brain.
She went on *Meetme.com*? Maybe she should focus on **meeting** an elliptical from time-to-time.
"off my chest" i suppose
what are you like the ass jamming expert here?Just kidding, but most definitely taped. While this thread is awesome I feel like this subreddit is actually trolling me. I've never seen so many disgusting fatplanets and their boobs in my life, and now I saw a dude's ballsack
He's a sneaky shitlord. Just being near the neckbeard makes him rage.
Kinda like her heart.
The difference between her and Tess is that Tess would actually be pretty if she lost weight. She has a nice face. This girl(?) does not

Fat people will never cosplay a fat character because they know that fat people are unattractive and do not want to be associated with them. fatlogic
That really depends though. Technically a "food addiction" isn't a *real* addiction however it can involve real addictions. Sugar affects the brain very similarly to drugs, even in terms of needing more and more each time to get a "fix" from it. Others with impulsive disorders can find themselves addicted to lots of "non-addictive" things as well. It's not an excuse though. Like anything else that's a problem, it's something that needs to be dealt with accordingly by the individual.

It's funny how all these diseases and genetics making people fat now weren't there 100 years ago. Or you know, in third world countries today.
Am ballet dancer, I know :P I'm just giving her shit.
Probably the fatty developed Necrotizing Fasciitis due to uncontrolled diabetes. It got to the point where the nurse was able to removed the leg. Pretty sad, but controllable with exercise, eating healthy, and doctor follow ups. Any pics available?

I think that's why lots of people put on weight in their ,20s. Drinking plus late night greasy food. Alcohol piles on the calories quick

Oh come now, what would people who've been in wars and encountered IEDs know about the terrible world of triggers? Don't you know that these brave people of girth have had to look at the word "fat" at times? Far worse than seeing people die in front of your eyes, or lose your own mobility within seconds.

It is a cult, and just about every former FA who loses weight is treated like a traitor. It's worse then crabs in a bucket, it's pathologic.

Swole tall ladies may be 10 or higher, but that's very rare. I'm 5'8" and will probably be a 2 at my goal weight, I'm a 4 now. My goal weight is 19.8 bmi, still not underweight. I point this out because on your frame a 2 might be tiny but on me I don't think so. This is why relativity matters. That's why I hate these ham's (pig in a) blanket remarks. Like 100 pounds being too skinny, depends entirely on your height and frame but they reference it like an end all be all criteria for anorexia, for example. Annoying.

Maybe a typo and she meant to say aren't? Only thing that makes sense.
Ugh and they're practically skin color making it an even more realistic portrayal of her fat nasty body. As if anyone WANTS to picture that.

theres just SO MUCH to GRAB ON TO! teehe~~~~
Do you really expect it to make something that looks good?
let's keep this our little secret.
Your rights end where my feelings begin, shitlord!
I believe this was used to represent the average weight. Which pisses me off. Average does not equal healthy. When the average in a country is overweight or obese, then average is not something you should aspire to. Unless you're really tall like the one woman here, saying you're average weight is just saying that you're fat just like everyone else, and is an excuse to not do anything about it.
Oxymoron right there.
That is such bullshit. My kids go to a hippie school where they are not allowed to have any sugary treats at all- not in lunches, at class parties, or for birthdays. The PE teacher has healthy cooking lessons once a month where the class communally brings in ingredients and cooks together. Even the hot lunch program is super healthy. Shitlord school all the way!
Submit to hard work.
Exactly! That shit is scary. Also I do believe that flap of skin does remain after weight loss. You know their body is done for when you see those second tits.
Lol no because TPW is a fucking bitch.
Seriously? Is he in a fucking starbucks?
They'd probably just eat it.
Only 5% of people are able to lose weight, no need to look into it, just take my word for it.

Well now I am triggered. Why do fat people eat enough food to feed an entire family for a whole week. Why should they eat that much when there are poor families who need that food to survive, not to mention all the famine stricken people.
How many calories do these chubbalumps think they expend by flipping the bird? They do it so often you'd think they thought that was the key to easy weight loss.

Sorry, new to this reddit thing, but when browsing on a computer, how do you get the images to be seen like that? I have to click and go to another page and then press back ect for each link.... How?
how do you control someone else's eating habits? Or how often she comes to the gym? Only so much a trainer can do in three to five hours a week.
finally, we have a scientifically verified, perfectly logical explanation for all those morbidly obese people starving to death in third world countries. and i always wondered about those 300-500 pound prisoners they photographed in auschwitz. now i know. it's their genetics.
Clearly you didn't.
No, I don't. Dammit, when I see a naked baby, I never think of their breasts in a way of "ooo boobs", not even as a "joke". I fail to see anything funny about a statement like that. Wtf! nobody sane says "haha I saw your boobs" as a joke when they see a baby! Nobody normal, anyway! Why does that even pop into your head when you see a baby girl?
no surprise brah
What the fuck is that monster?
I can't put my finger on it, but this pic is grosser to me than a lot of the NSFW ones.
Why do so manny hams slouch? Is it because all that weight makes it hard to stand up straight or are they trying to hide their bellies?

I think this gallery was on this subreddit a while back and it was revealed that the 'artist' was a fat fetishist and just used this for spank material. I'm probably wrong though, my memory is pretty shoddy
There may not even be abuse or overt abuse. Sometimes it's more like just Stockholm syndrome. Low self-esteem is a bitch, you put up with a lot if you don't feel worthy.
As it should be.
What's up with that girl who was "killed in battle"'s left arm?????
Portion control is so fucking important, it is insanely easy to eat foods that are bad for you and maintain a healthy weight as long as you don't eat a ton of it. For dinners this week for instance, I made a caramelized onion, goat cheese, and basil flat bread with a balsamic reduction on Monday. Tuesday I made a farro salad with roasted grape tomatoes, rosemary, thyme, and goat cheese. Wednesday was baked salmon sliders with a chipotle mayo and roasted brussels sprouts. And Thursday was roasted asparagus and baked salmon with a citrus sauce. Any of those could result in me being a fatass if I ate enough of it, that's why you keep the portion sizes down. It also helps that my breakfast and lunch are always something healthy. Breakfast is pretty much always an 8oz "green juice" that I make with my juicer, usually has some kale, apple, ginger, spinach, lemon juice, shit like that. Followed by 3/4 cup of oatmeal, with just some cinnamon and some variety of dried fruit, no added sugar. Lunch is usually just some small healthy meal thrown together with whatever I happen to have at the time. Also, obviously no soda and I never snack.
I've had this saved for a long time![Imgur](URL
Will do! XD
I'm surprised that it is only up to 8 years. If life expectancy in Western countries is about 80 years, it means that they should see their 70th birthday, while in reality many of them croak much earlier in their 40's or 50's.
I can see where the confusion would be.
She's at a point where even the most ingenious Myspace angle can't help her at all. Beyond planetary status, no less then a gas giant, yep.

Ah, okay gotcha.
hey fuck you man
I find it hard to believe she has the ability to use Photoshop. It actually takes some skill which is beyond her range of being photographed like a whale washed ashore.She's either using lighting tricks, makeup tricks or having someone airbrush it for her.
The one thing people don't understand about fluid retention is that if it caused you to gain 30lbs overnight you need to find an emergency room immediately.

It's actually very common for Mormons to be overweight or obese. I grew up mormon mostly in Utah so I'm very familiar with the culture.

He does share 50/50 custody, yeah. And I know, it's a lot to take on. His ex is a really terrible mother (lazy, dirty, neglectful, treats the poor girl like an adult instead of a child) and I do worry about how she will be affected by that. She has terrible eating habits because her mom doesn't enforce healthy eating, but she isn't fat or overweight at all (yet). I lament certain aspects of my relationship but you gotta take the bad with the good. Right?
Can't be sure. PM me your nudes just in case.
Anything above a BMI of 24.9 is considered overweight and not accepted here, unless you have extreme swole privilege.
Oh man. We [as in the whole nation of Australia] had a big discussion about a fat tax on airlines. The media has written and filmed about it before and then an airline floated the idea and so many people were in favour but somehow they didn't follow through. I have never been so excited then deflated within 3 or 4 days about a news story I cared about. Especially since it was after sitting next to a 30BMI alcoholic man for 12 hours. I wish they would limit fatties baggage weight to at least make up for the unfairness or charge by total weight. Thin privilege is getting woken up to let a ham up out of its row. And not just next to you but behind you. It's like mega turbulence that jolts you awake when they selfishly shake your seat. Fucking shits!
I think we're quite spead out. Though probably too much since we only have one or two that are active in peak times.

Water all day. Was on the swim team in high school and one of coaches rules was no carbonated drinks during the season. We would go out to eat as a team after a meet, and everyone just ordered water. That was 4 years ago and I don't think I've ever ordered anything other than water since then.
...oh my god. I love you.

I hope she doesn't eat the poor donkeys :/
I think you should require objective measurements of weight i.e. people have to enter how many pounds they weigh and this number is searchable/filterable.
I've seen pictures that cannot be unseen. I'll spare you the horror. Go look for them on your own when you mustered enough courage.
Same, give me a pie, a crumble, a doughnut, a creme brûlée… anything is a better calories to taste deal than even the best cake has to offer.
Thin privilege is not having video game bosses look like you
-seeing your bones where they are supposed to be seen, eg. collarbones, knees...-not having to worry about distances in the city because you're going to walk anywhere within 4 miles anyway -not being hungry all the time-not worrying what people think about you based on your looks because that'd be positive thoughts only, except from hams
Whale no 10 kgs fatter than should b yes. Second she is a bitch she fucks with my head all the time for fun once i herd the voice of my dead daughter and tried to bash her out of my head by smashing my into the corner of a brick wall and she just yelled at me for it. She tells me she's going to take my living daughter to Queensland and the. Doesn't do it everything she does is just to mess with me
There's actually health issues that are present for particularly tall or short people, specifically because of their height. But that's just me being a pedantic ass.

I'll be able to bench press the weight of Tess Muncher and Ragen Chafestain put together.Also, quitting smoking. I hate how hypocritical I am, making fun of fatties for killing themselves with food while I do the same with cigarettes.

So you had sex with an eatbeast. Is that what you're saying? *HOW COULD YOU?!*
I mean, to be fair, I have had to wear wide calf boots for a long time. I was a national level athlete and my calves were just incredibly thick. I'm bigger now than I used to be (though you can look at my other posts and see that I'm in a healthy weight range) but even when I had a body fat percentage of 18% (as a woman) I couldn't wear skinny jeans of normal sized boots. Not saying this is the case for this girl, but it's not entirely awful to have boots with bigger calves.
Not really, it is estimated to be about 90% females and just 10% males who suffer anorexia. That is not "so many". Also, it is estimated about 1 in 250 people suffer from it. So if the U.S. has a population of about 325,000,000 then approximately 1,170,000 women suffer from it to about 130,000 men.
OP is a fox, would totally date

Ummm so you converted a racist over to our side?
I was told my passenger was biased. Even YOUR reports are considered shit unless someone was dumb enough to make it evident it was their fault. The reports are just procedural. So she said you ran the red light, you said she did. A very biased witness says it was her fault.It's not a democracy when it comes to these things. 2 to 1 finger pointing doesn't mean anything if the '2' will have a bias in favor of an outcome. Unbiased witnesses are the WORST-best case evidence you can get. To be honest, you should of told your friend to go stand at the intersection corner and pretend to not know you.At least then the fattie would need evidence to prove otherwise.
OP is making us look like morons - that's called a Caroline's Cart and it is for handicapped children - not hamtots!
Im half convinced these are fits in fat suits and this is all a joke.There isn't a fat-scooter in sight.
If there is, I'm going to pretend there isn't. T_T

Huh.. thats actually an interesting question.
It's called not being a pussy."Hey fat fuck, get your fat off my fucking seat"No additional supplies needed
Thank you for NOT focusing.
Yeah, which is incredible... the sickness, discomfort, and general condition changes experienced in some pregnancies are just a daily reality for the fatties. But who the fuck really cares about incontinence or indigestion or peeing yourself or barfing every morning or feeling like there's a thing growing inside you when there isn't, right?
I totally understand that the sky is the limit, and that no one is ever going to have a negative BMI. My issue is that it would be more accurate to call the show Super Fat vs. Slightly Underweight. I take issue with the fact that many of us, myself included, have been called skinny while being well within the normal BMI range. Why perpetuate that BS? Call it what it is. We need to recalibrate the fatties who think that since the "average" person is now a fat ass that anything less than that is skinny.
it's as much of a 'thing' as tess monster is. it's a thing any half-reasonable person laughs about with disgust. don't worry.
sushi isnt supposed to be covered in mayo sauce. I instantly leave whatever japanese restaurant im ordering from if i see that happen.

I think those results are probably skewed by fat tumblr users who identify as lesbian when they in fact probably aren't even. I know plenty of lesbians and I would say on the whole they keep themselves in better shape than the majority of straight people.

That was a great post. Sadly, most fatties would rather take 10 pills a day to keep their organs from failing than actually exercise and change their diet.

I'm willing to believe there are guys out there nice enough to not want to insult a mother in public. I'm even willing to believe the guy is hot. The moment she mentioned "real woman" it all went to hell.
Oh my God that's perfect!
Why do I always click on the NSFW links here. I'm much less repulsed by a pile of shit or an infected wound. I'm astounded by how delusional the pro-fat movement is. How does she have the nerve to leave the house let alone be photographed looking like that. Disgusting.
been 9 months for me, but I'm an introvert who doesn't meet many people. :/
Too much hair, definitely a calf.
That's what I was thinking - most of the photos look the same as usual.
That's because most of the fat sympathizers and fatties are also SJWs. That means feminist to the point of rabidity.
We also don't really sue often in New Zealand
Trigger warning for the fatty or for the brussel sprout that clearly just triggered her?
My kids aren't old enough for school but I've still had my mind blown by things people feed their kids. And I don't mean as occasional treats, but as regular snacks/meals. One of my pet peeves is fruit snacks. So many parents assume they're healthy - have they ever glanced at the label? It's basically just corn syrup and dye.If you want to eat garbage, I guess that's your choice, but don't feed it to your growing child on a daily basis.
And they kinda look alike, wasn't Mallory based off of her by any chance?
Well, NASA will *never* put a hambeast in space, simply because of how much extra fuel it would take to get them up there.So our future space colonists will be shitlords, truly!

Are we allowed to send "fat offenders" to Fatopia? Because...because that would be hilarious. You can get out if you lose weight.
Well, that'll teach me to underestimate the horridness of a ham.

I would smoke and drink coffee pretty much all day every day. most of my calories came from coffee and fruit. I was never hungry. But I smoked like every 45 minutes, multiple cigs each time. I could barely last through class without one. But yeah, I took way too much addy, lol
This looks like an ad for prostitution on Craigslist or something. So trashy.
Thanks for taking one for the team bro. Even though I know I could lose it, I wouldn't be able to let myself gain that much weight. Especially from a starting point like his.

You can't see inside her muscle wall. Her abdomen could be filled with adipose tissue, organs wrapped in fat, bone marrow pushed out and replaced with fat, her blood pumping fat round her body.You can't tell the body fat of someone with your eyes, that's why we have things like BMI.

What's a SAMH or PCOS or any of the other abbreviation stand for..?
Yeah, the second one is what I was looking for, thanks.
I had a membership to Planet Fitness because it was cheap and the fat bitch behind the counter kept pushing the tanning beds on me. I had the executive pass or some higher member card because of free parking and I guess with that the tanning bed was a perk and it was like 5 bucks more a month. Anyway, I have really fair skin and reddish hair. A suntan and I parted ways a long time ago and I happily embrace fair skin but for some reason every time I went in she would without fail remind me that "I'm free to use the tanning beds if I wanted" or "you know with the membership you have the tanning beds are free." I'm assuming since I wasn't going to die of obesity she wanted me to have skin cancer.

Oh yeah I agree. We're saying the same thing. I was just replying something similar to OP when they deleted everything. Guess it was a fatty.
DAMN IT. IT WAS AN ASSIGNMENT!! ;n; and it said SCATTER it was a chart thing for my economics class. I am hating it even more as the days go on because of shit like this! D:
The only thing this might fall under is that employers cannot discriminate against the *disabled*. Even then: ---The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 protects individuals who possess, or are thought to possess, a wide range of disabilities, ranging from paraplegia to Down Syndrome to autism. **However, it does not force an employer to employ a worker whose disability would create an "undue hardship" onto his business (for example, a paraplegic cannot work on a construction site, and a blind person cannot be a chauffeur).** Similar protections have been in place for Federal employees and customers of federal agencies and contractors since 1973 under the Rehabilitation Act.---Having to pay more money to accomodate obesity sounds like undue hardship.
Do you keep tabs on her? Did she ever end up with a fatty?
Lol I went to a cafe with my mum not realizing there was a "ahem" cum stain on my inner shoulder. Mum goes "oh dear did you spill food on your top" "ooooh yeh hehe" :0
Watching her try to talk with half of her face immobilized and drool coming out of her mouth would amuse me.
I've seen "food before dudes" on hams around here.
Because someone is still fucking them. As a man, I blame the rest of men for the dwindling headcount of even moderately in shape women and the proliferation of.. Whatever that is. If they'd just stop fucking these things, the situation would turn around QUICK.
Lack of places for the fats to hide.
See, this shit right here really pisses me off. If the woman on the cover is a "real woman," then is a thin woman not "real" enough?Also, I found an Amazon review mentioning that the book offered modifications of poses to prevent one's "curves" from getting in the way. If you need to modify a yoga pose* because your lardy rolls are preventing you from doing it, maybe you should consider modifying your body so that it can move like a normal human being?*not hating on anyone human sized who has to modify a pose to fit their flexibility or strength level if they are new to yoga
Oh boy I like this a lot. I'm going to use that to rustle some jimmies.

Grey-asexual: Very rarely feels sexual attraction to anyone of any gender. Like maybe once or twice.
This is what makes the furry fandom look bad :/

Having lived in both countries I reckon that while the rate of obesity as medically defined is similar in both countries, the percentage of truiuuly huuuuuge lardasses is vastly higher in the US. Fat people in Australia tend to have a big gut out front and that's most of it. They rarely explode out to the side the way US fats do. It's interesting, actually, and I wonder why. High fructose corn syrup?
My uncle and his family go on cruises once or twice a year. *Every time* he tries to convince my family to go, too, and is all surprised when I put my foot down (my mom is "eh" with the idea, but fortunately, my dad hates cruises as much as I do.) How can cruises be *that* enjoyable? The food is so mediocre, the rooms are claustrophobic as fuck, and there's basically nothing to do on the ship. Then you reach land for like, what? One or two days, and then you have to get back on the ship. The bulk of your trip is on a fucking ship. How fun!
The fatty already threw away their own life, why should you risk yours for them. Fuck them.
I got thanked by the day shift nurse in the maternity wing for following their dietary rules while i was there after I had my daughter. Apparently I was one of the rare diabetics who didn't bitch when presented with my low-sodium, low-carb meal.

What the fuck does the sex/race/gender/sexual orientation/etc of an author have to do with anything? This is just blatant bigotry and idiotic ad hominem bullshit that gets promoted and propped up for no good reason.

Kaufland. Metro is only for companies and I'm a university student so I'm not allowed. I made the comparison because they're both cheap and huge. I wish I could though as their meat is cheap.
If you go to the butcher to get pork fat (for making venison sausages) they wrap it in plastic wrap.

Yeah it's been posted and reposted many times here
Thank god. Because if the fatties think they can parkour I'm done.
So I can't sleep and I googled "small fats" and got to read them arguing with er "big fats" I guess about "thin privilege" You know back in the old days you had to PAY for a freak show, but now you get it for free!
I honestly thought this person was mentally retarded the first time I watched it.
Not sure how much an extra fuckton is in this case, butHow can you stand that? It's viscerally unappealing to have a huge amount of salt overpowering the flavor and ruining the texture of whatever it is that you're eating. And too much olive oil... ugh. When it gets incredibly coated like that I can't stand it.But then again these are the people that think that salt, herbs, and butter (in moderation, Paula) are unhealthy for you.
When I was a teenager I weighed 125 lbs. it wasn't uncommon for me to be up to 135 lbs by the end of the day. I are like shit though so I assume high sodium was causing ridiculous bloating and water retention

They're supposedly really great. Wash your hands thoroughly both before and after. I guess fatasses can't use them, it liberally never occurred to me before this thread.
I like the way you think!
I actually have a friend who prefers fat girls. We mutually know a chubby girl, I've been calling her fat and he's been telling her she's good the way she is. After not seeing her for a month I think she lost weight. I think I'm winning.But yeah guys that are like that actually exist and that scares me.
This post gave me cancer. She thinks weighing 250lb at 5'4" is healthy; and eating 1000cals a day and staying at that weight? Woman is psychotic.
That plus the make up she is just trying to look like a real life thin person.
I mean that you should be allowed to disagree to homosexual marriage, adoption and whatsoever.

That's the first commercial that came to my mind. Ironically, I only see it while I'm at the gym at 3am. Even the DJ is a raging fatass. Sad commentary on their target demographic.

This. I feel this way for all GW subs. I told a male friend that he (and everyone really) should downvote ugly/fat chicks and gross boobs and gynies so that only "quality" ones will want to post and he said with all seriousness "no because that will discourage girls from posting anything, all boobs are good, especially naked ones". His ex-fiancée was a massive (can't venture to guess her weight) vertically-challenged fatty with a chronic toe fungus so I can't say I was surprised. Not all boobs are created equal.

We share the rage honey. We share the rage.The fat beasts think that belly dancing requires a belly &gt;.&gt; The origins of belly dancing did have larger women. LARGER FOR THE TIME PERIOD.the women were of a BMI range that was 22 to 26 not over 40. Because it was attractive to see a woman who was 10lbs heavier than the average woman shaking the muscular and lush body. Not a fat body
No, the point is that she's just going to keep replying and I don't want to get Carpal Tunnel from replying to him, I honestly don't want to spend all day arguing with her because she will just keep pushing her agenda onto me, I don't think she's right and she doesn't think I'm right, so there's no point in arguing over it. If you look up what I said, that has scientific merit to it as well, yes she argues claiming scientific bullshit but has not linked or provided citations and even if she did I could just link my points with scientific studies also. Seriously the gal must be on her period or something.

34, class of '99. Small rural school in western WI with 30 graduates. Can remember one fat guy and 3 girls that would qualify. Two of those were very big, with one having been that way since the beginning and one slowly earning through the years.

They are harder to flip than cheetahs - Experience.... No it's not...
Just to clarify, size does NOT equal mass. For example, a 10" steel ball will have more mass than a 20" snowball. If we define size as volume, then yes, something can be "smaller" and be more massive than another object. I'm just clarifying that for science, what the hamplanet said in the OP is not true, since humans are made from the same elements, so it's reliable to compare their mass by their observable volume.edit: To further clarify, mass =/= weight. Your weight is different depending on gravity, i.e. you weigh differently in outer space, but your mass is the same. But yes, larger humans have more mass than smaller humans, unless the skinny people suddenly ingest lots of heavy metals.

Okay, I don't think I could beat a six minute mile. That's ten miles an hour if my math isn't on cocaine again. I'm hitting a seven and a half, and I'm not a gym nut, so that seems reasonable.

*"Even though he’s performed thousands of bariatric surgeries, Baker hasn’t lost sight of the harsh, invasive nature of what’s happening in that video. He explains that he spends most of each surgery attempting to gain access to the stomach. Obese patients have so much fat, not to mention an enlarged stomach and liver, that the workspace is cramped. The flimsy spleen is close by, as well. Brush it ever so slightly and it’ll bleed. Plus, there are vessels hidden in the fat. If a surgeon hits a vessel that starts to bleed, it sets off a frantic search to find the source."*omg.
They aren't even fat though /s
To be fair, fat people are stupid.
Why are you calling them "EDNOS bitches"? So basically you're saying they don't have an ED? The amount of rage this induces in me.
Agreed. The Matrix club scenes are definitely NOT representative of real life! Real goths, alternative lifestylers, LARPers etc. are usually fat or ugly.
Lolol I'll take looking like a man (not like that even happens) over looking like a poop emoticon.
Well thanks for responding to me. I enjoy listening to what other people have to say.Also, to get flared on this subreddit do you have to be fit/somewhat muscular or just not be fat?
Honestly this is like that old question "What weights more, a kg of bricks or a kg of feathers?" A kg of muscle weight the same amount as a kg of fat. However a kg of fat will have a much larger surface than the kg of muscles. Muscle is "denser".

6'6'' here, I didn't notice all that hate.It is simply harder for tall people to be in the 18-25 BMI index, because it stop working after a certain height, but any photo can reassure on the shitlordiness of tall people!As I always remind, good nutrition led to be taller and to follow a proper nutrition later in life. Height is correlated with being fit.

They'd probably try to sue the store for not catering to their condisuns.
Exactly. The people on the top, when I look at them, they look like people I can follow. They look like people that have a vision, and just, like you said, modesty. Looks like confidence with humbleness. And the bottom could just walk it's sorry ass to /r/punchablefaces
It really has more to do with how stretchy your skin is or not. Same with baby belly stretch marks. Someone do nothing to prevent them and still get none other do it all and get severe ones and everything inbetween. Try talking out your ass less...

bf% isn't perfect, but it's a lot more accurate... there are several methods and you're right, it isn't something that could be calculated by just looking at a scale.
Clearly it was a typo. "It" would be proper here.

ugh thats so annoying. A lot of the time I buy athletic pants in small they are tight around my calves but waaay to big around my hips and butt. Like there is *supposed* to be a big fupa there. It's like they are planning for girls to have huge asses and stomachs but no leg muscles at all

You know in movies, when vampires get hit with sunlight and they start to burn and die. This is what this reminds me of. The stage right before they burst into flames and die. Except if it bursted Into flames the amount of grease in its skin would cause an explosion.
Er, no, she needs a man to man the harpoons.
that isn't so bad. Lots of skinny nerds
I think part of why acupuncture helps people is because it triggers an inflammatory response which then makes endorphins and stuff. I suppose with it just being in fat, the inflammatory response wouldn't be as evident.
They do exist. It's not supper common, but you have to consider that only about 8% of women have an hourglass figure, and even then not all of them are are that exaggerated. There are also some fatties who are hourglass because of their distribution. The point being, you're taking 8% and whittling it down from there, so I would say the body type in the picture is probably about 1-2% of the female population as a generous estimate.

I'm gonna go off on a limb and assume that all the non fatties saw this group and decided not to go.
I just found this subreddit and I'm loving it so thank you, shitlords and ladies. Off topically, I'm finally starting my new years resolution and I'm going to start training to run a 5k. My boyfriend is doing it with me and I'm super stoked. I'm not overweight just really out of shape so this is going to be really good for me :)
It says that people looking at "her" makes it feel uncomfortable. "Her" being alive makes me feel uncomfortable! If I had to see this ham in real life it might actually make me sick. Dumb fucking selfish hams need to cover up or stay inside their barns.
That poor zookeeper....
I've been considering this lately. Theres a good indoor spot not far from my house. An old church refurbed into a climbing space. I think I'm going to join when it's in my budget.

So far no one has responded, and it's been up for 40 minutes. Then again, she posts so much shit daily I'm sure most people have her blocked. I keep her around so I can laugh at her pictures.
I thought they had pretty tough physical examinations. This shouldn't happen.
Priceless, the car cover from Ozzys tour bus.
Yes, I have seen it. I watched a landwhale inhale an entire 16 inch pizza at the place I worked in college. In 7 minutes. In one sitting!There was a street cleaner that worked over nights when I did at 7-11 (Murican convenience store) that would come in 6 to 8 times a night to refill his big gulp. That's 52 ounces each time.Thing is, many of them do not believe thatovereating makes you fat
It's funny until you realize some people take it seriously.

Yeah... Real actual rape, not the fake rape culture crap that keeps being shoved down my throat, I can support a woman who is actually raped. The second girl I went into a relationship with was "raped" and that's how she and her entire family told me she got pregnant. Of course that was a lie.Just like the last girl I thought about girlfriending up. No kids but also had her "I've been raped" stories that she told me were just lies to get attention.And if contraception fails it's just a consequence. Sometimes contraception fails. That's part of the responsibility of having sex. Actions have consequences. When we remove all responsibility for everything we end up with HAES.We also end up with the single mother culture we now have. Hell over one third of every single child is now being raised by a single mother and rather then address the problem of no responsibility we keep shoving excuses and entitlements at the people who just made poor decisions so that they don't have to be responsible.I try not to try to get into real discussions of the toxic cultural marxism on reddit or really anywhere except PMs and RL people but I, and many other people, are grown sick and tired of our ridiculous culture that wants to remove all responsibility from women and give them entitlements so they never have to grow into good people.Sex has consequences. Every time I have sex with someone I realize that there are real consequences for it. Hell even OCTR receptor damage. Each person I have sex with has a consequence. Our current culture is the result of pretending like there are no consequences for the things women want to do.
This sag-squatch is a trainwreck.
I've had that plenty of times in high school. Especially on band trips where I would go through a 13oz bag of hot cheetos in 2 days. Apparently they (by they I mean the women who were fairly overweight) thought I did this all the time and kept asking how I stayed skinny.To be honest I only did this when a band trip occurred and throughout the rest of the week snacks would hardly come my way due to being in a large family and not being able to afford the junk stuff and my parents focusing more on getting the best food possible with the income we had. Oh and me being involved in athletics which always kept involving us having to do endurance drills as punishment because some fuckwad decided it would be cool to smart off to the coach.
That's mean to corn dogs :c
I don't think I'm the one getting worked up about how someone looks.

The term "butter chud" won a special place in my heart

I never go to salons with fat stylists. I go to the expensive places that won't give you bad haircuts. It's worth it. The staff will all be hotter than you so you know they know what looks good.
I think if a barista complains like that to ANY customer they should be at least reprimanded, if not fired. If the customer is being a bitch it is onoe thing. But getting annoyed because they're ordering something healthy? Piss off.
Sigma Kappa for us. Called them Sigma Cattle
No problem. I was really interested in it too, and I have to adjust anyway because the standard 2000 calorie diet is way too much for me (even when I'm active), so I was definitely not going off of the generalized recommendations.

I haven't seen the article in question, but my guess as to what it says is that bananas contain a radioactive isotope (potassium). It's true, but not really relevant unless you eat truckloads of bananas.
This is just like in the film 'sightseers'. Never thought that could really be a thing though...
I love when I see shitlording other places besides on FPH. Imagine how beautiful the earth would be with no hams...and I mean the actual earth. There would be so much less trash, we would need less energy, the atmosphere and land would be so much less destroyed.

Fat people working at the gym always confuses me. Especially when said fattys are personal trainers ... gtfo since no one's going to take you seriously.
and tides *are* important
So you weigh 203.05?
I am not shallow I just have standards. There is a huge difference. Being a freak doesn't mean you are good at sex. It just probably means the fatty needs ten cans of whip cream to perform coitus.
Sure, hurry up and get pregnant instead of taking care of the 1 year old you have now . . .
Does he breathe though his mouth as he chomps away? Ugh when they exhale deeply between each bite they take.
Yes. Search the fat positive tags like pizzasisters, fatbabe, body positive, all that stupid shit and eventually you'll find the posts that tear down thin women; show those to her.
Next time grow a pair and tell it to go away.
I love your comment. Body acceptance is for you. You can't control being born with asthma but you sure as fuck didn't let it control you. I used to play paintball with a kid who had asthma and I swear I never knew he had it until he had a really bad attack mid game. He hit that inhaler fucking hard and then popped right back up to fire a fucking volley that took out 3 players. He couldn't run far but he was a quick mother fucker short distances.

I personally don't know of any fat people that can cook. They just dump cans or packets into something cover it with something from a bag and then bake it or put it in a crock pot. Maybe use some jarred or canned sauce. My skinny ass will be having chicken of the woods quesadillas with homemade guacamole tonight but you definitely shouldn't trust me.
glad im not the only one leaning away from fatlogic, its too sympathetic to fat people now. This is my mecca now
Just because you write it on your body, doesn't mean it's true. You can say things 5 trillion times, it doesn't make it true. This is such a childish primitive way of forcing beliefs on people. It reminds me of the nuh uhhhh, uh huhhhh argument that children get into.
Just leave them to their pain, ffs
It's legit, but only if you're actually about to starve to death. The body slows your metabolism right down to try and protect you. But you'll never gain weight because of it.
As an expert in watching Embarrassing Bodies surgeries, I'm gonna say reduction.
Hell, I wouldn't do it for any amount of money. It's just not worth it.
Well then, you've made a fine choice indeed.
I don't. Working as an operator/contractor/private security officer has just been something I've been looking into for a while. I just looked up the PPS cert., but I think I'm pulling up the wrong one because that's for some kind of school related counseling and medical rehab certs. Mind enlightening me as to what it is? Edit: Never mind, found the right one.
In Orlando, at universal, before some of the rides (Harry potter and the forbidden journey, the hulk, doctor dooms fear fall, etc)They had those sample seats.The explanation for it was great. It was something along the lines of saying "this seat may not accommodate to people with certain upper body dimensions" or some shit like that.There were tons of hams there too,While in line for the hulk my brain had a marvelous idea.A shitlord amusement park to be exact.To be let in the person at the counter needs to pinch you with bf calipers.If you are 5% under the maximum acceptable bf% for your gender, you get a sticker.10% you get to skip lines.And you would have people dressed in fat suits acting like tumblrina/tumblrino (s) for entertainmentI'm still brainstorming about it
If she's in the US pizza is already a vegetable anyways. ;-)
I was enjoying all of the roller whales who we're staying at the trailer park lodge at WDW. Everyone there had a golf cart in tow behind their trailer and many drove scootypuffs around the parks. P. S. I only saw this because the wdw buses stopped there. I was staying at a hotel for the ambulatory.
I saw a hammy at subway once that got a side dish of that chipotle sauce and was dipping EVERY bite of her sammich into it. It was a steak and cheese footer I believe. It disgusted me and it made me curious so I looked up the nutritional infomration of the chipotle sauce. HO-LE-FUCK
That's enough reddit for today.
Yup, mine says I should weigh 10lbs more than I actually do.
Fuck off, fatass.Banned.
You can't abuse personal liberty.If you could, than it wouldn't be a liberty.
Oh she definitely uses those things to eat everything as a kebab.
I hate that shit. "Oh, you just wait until your metabolism slows down, you'll get fat." The fuck I will. The minute I start to gain ANY weight (from fat, not muscle) I'll be stoked that I can now eat less food. Saves money and time.
I just had to stay two hours late because some fat fuck who was supposed to help me close literally chose to eat and bitch about life instead. I genuinely want to punch anyone who says fat people ARENT disgusting right now.

I was banned from /r/fatlogic for pointing out fat logic, logical.
I can shed some light on this. In the gay community, with a growing number in the past few years especially, there is a relatively large number of "daddy chasers". Daddy chasers can be of any age, meaning they like a guy that is matured, developed, much in the same way young straight guys like cougars. And to some of the twinks, although they won't admit it, its about financial stability because these men are generally financially well off. Although some of us younger gays do find some older guys attractive, it is usually very fit, very masculine men that we fantasize about. Hence the word "daddy" because fathers are portrayed as strong, masculine and caretakers. The thing is, these types of mature men, especially ones that are fit, don't typically go for younger guys and are usually attracted to guys around their age. They are in high demand. This is where these disgusting fat fucks come into play. They are very desperate, and because they know that younger men are very easy to bait, they prey on them.I have no issues with legal consenting adults, no matter how old or how young, being together. I do however find these fucking lardasses problematic because they are simply physically revolting, and twist the fantasies of young men into something disgusting.

Their concept of trying is buying "healthy" food then eating unhealthy food. I've seen this happen before.
So, I have two coworkers, massive cunts. Like, the size of cunts you see on here. One must be more than 300kg. Its a fire hazard for both of them to be out back at work.

I actually contracted T2 beetus from viewing this album. Shitlords beware.
I can get two double cheeseburgers, 20 chicken nuggets, and fries for less than half of what it says for the McDonalds prices. I'm pretty sure all the cost in the pic is coming from noncombo soda.On the other spectrum, I'm really wondering where I can get the healthy meat for those prices. A pound of chicken breasts for a dollar? Not happening, and I would question the quality of meat if it did.But, what I really want to talk about is the expectation of **4 people**. "Hey, here's the prices for 4 people!" Well, what about the prices for 1? That's when it starts to hurt.Take a loaf of bread, for example. Yeah, sure, per slice it's cheap! Except I have a whole loaf here. And it's really hard to go through a loaf by myself before it starts to go bad. Food waste has a cost, it takes a lot of work to not waste anything and quite a bit of creativity unless you want to eat the same thing every day.I eat healthy. But it's not cheaper than if I went to McDonald's every day and got some cheap junk food. That grocery bill is expensive even if I'm just getting some staples. Stop trying to pretend otherwise.
Lookin' good, shitlord!
I can only imagine what lives in that chin flap
Thank you.
Swole guys will encroach due to width. Worst flight ever for me was being stuck between two guys who were built and wide as hell. I couldn't even sit back in my own seat.No hate in this statement, just truth. At least they were good looking. But DAMN my back was wrecked.
DELUSIONAL
He got gay.
As a swole shitlord, I'd still be cool with it. At the end of the day, I still don't weight nearly as much as a fatty
I can't believe you guys feel bad for this lazy, self-absorbed self-pity-party. Like fuck, I feel sorry for people with problems who can't overcome them, not people who can't even be bothered to try. Like oh boo hoo I'm fat and ugly and clingy and have no job. Get over it bitch, do something.
She'll run out of mana at some point and need ~~mana potions~~ Mt Dew to restore her ~~MP~~ sugah levelz
The fuck ?! The girl in the front may not be toned/skinny but I wouldn't be so fast to jump into the bandwagon and call her fat. Fat distrubution isnt the same for everybody, and hell, even skinny/fit people look bad in an unflattering angle: URLHer armpit flab can simply be attributed to lack of toning + unflattering posture + fat distribution.
The hundred dollar nike running shoes are a nice touch.
I can't help but curl my nose in disgust at these things when I see them in public. Also, I live in the south so my face is pretty much stuck like that.
I'm in great shape, I can knock out a 6 min mile, bench 1.5x BW, squat even more and I am absolutely sure a marathon would lay me out for a week if I tried to run one. If you don't endurance train, you will not have the endurance needed to complete one without causing yourself some serious discomfort. 26 miles aint no joke. The first guy that did it died at the end, that's all the reason I need to not do one. That a fatty thinks they can go from the buffet line to the finish line is so absurd I don't even pay it any attention.
"disease". Lmao.
[They know](URL
I believe you need to delete the name. Also, I totally commented.---You said in another comment:&gt;I would be fine with them providing the fat chair, as that eliminates the legwork mentioned earlierYou are literally saying, "I am so fat that I have destroyed property other people pay for, and I demand they spend even more money because I don't want to do any amount of energy that might contribute to burning up extra calories."This is pretty much a textbook definition of "fat and entitled". You have eaten your way beyond the point of fitting into a chair made to accommodate a human body. You are asking people to pay extra money to accommodate you instead of doing anything at all for yourself. You are the problem, you cost people money, and you're asking that other people continue to cater to you because you not only refuse to lose weight but you refuse to do absolutely anything for yourself that would involve some semblance of physical activity.That is not discrimination on their part. That is you demanding things from society that you have no right to demand. People like you are the reason r/fatpeoplehate exists.---I wonder how many downvotes I'll get.
It looks like they had their nails done and ditto is going to take a picture.
They are just protecting their investment.
This ham will never reach that age and if so will just be on their beetus mobile
She skipped the double chin and opted for the double neck
Without the claws the fat would grow over normal nails.
Some went onto japanese 2, did not see them after.
Fuckin' hell that's stone cold.
my experiences have been almost universally good, only truly catfished once - most people are up front and sites have feedback and photo verification so u can see people are who they say they are. Catfished through grindr, weird thing was the guy wasnt even bad looking or fat or anything...if he had sent pics of himself I would have met him anyway...but people are weird.
&gt;Aww poor fatty fee feesI'm stealing this haha
He does. Or at least the staff don't actively restrict his diet. In the article he says he orders pizzas then eats them alone. I'm assuming he just called the place, gave them his address and room number and they probably got let right in.
I can't believe that the proportion of normal (and underweight people) is smaller than either the proportion of overweight or obese. What has this world come to?
Fat sacks of crap...They're everywhere.pull up a standard 18" chair and enjoy a mug of whey protein!
I'd honestly rather be gay than fuck a girl that size.
Has there ever been a total lardass amputee that still gets around on it's own like that? Every amputee I have seen that is fully functional with a prosthetic is able to do it because they are otherwise fit as hell.
&gt; Truth hurts huh.That would require something you said to be true as opposed to a delusional attempt to protect your ego.
Ranch is a liquid, dumbass. It doesn't have any calories. She'll have to eat a package of Oreos instead.

I hardly ate anything Thursday night. I forced some chocolate down at 10pm just so I'd eaten something. Stress eating does not make sense to me, I would've thrown any more back up.
That's beautiful. So sustainable.

I don't understand what it has on the bottom...the striped part. Is it covering a leg or the second fupa?
Well, the gym I used to go to (have home gym now) was run by this guy that was awesome, and they had a few personal trainers who were also awesome. Also some awesome regulars. So me, as a 31-year-old dude trying to get from skinny-flab to fit had a lot of boosters. That helped a ton. But here's the thing you just have to get over: lift weights, lift *free weights on a bench*, and honestly, nobody gives a shit. That's a tough obstacle for a lot of people. You might see a guy doing 150-lb skull-crushers, and you think he's judging you for doing 15-lb Arnolds. No, the truth is that after that crushing set, the other guys are trying to get their vision straight again and beef up for the next set. They don't give a fuck about you. (If you do not normally have a set where you are almost blind afterward from working yourself so hard, you have not worked out properly. Keep that in mind. Squats. x20 if you have to.)You really need to come to grips with this and internalize it, and become someone who is so focused on their workout that they hardly notice others' routines. YouTube is filled with videos of people showing you how to do a lift properly. And most fit people in gyms are cool as shit, just ask them and they will probably help you. I mean, I felt kind of stupid asking a kid half my age to help me with my deadlift, but the dude lifted twice as much as I could at the time, and he was so gracious and helpful. You just have to sacrifice the ego a bit.
LOL
ugh because they're not geek culture regurgitation
I need so many other people to understand this comment. Fantastic
Explained that way it now makes total sense to me. I have some BDSM suspension gear and It's literally the same thought. If you're moving around, swaying or jerking then you are exerting multiple times your bodyweight.... Don't know why I didn't think that in the first place. Thanks!

I was actually there to get mushrooms and spinach for omelets. I love Sam's for the produce but I guess most of the people that shop there have never been in that section.
Then they'd ask for a law that a doctor isn't allow to tell fat people about their unhealthy lifestyle unless he got explicit and enthusiastic consent. Because he'd be weight-raping them otherwise.
The part that kills me the most is the fact they eat 10,000 calories a day, put in no work, and just want to take the short cut and say "I'm beautiful too, I'm hot".No you aren't, you fucking fat fucks. Try 2,000 calories a day. Try cardio. Try lifting. Mother fucking EARN looking good.Rant over.Thanks for the welcomes.

She is smaller than she was, but that skin holds tons of subcutaneous fat cells. If fact, as far as I can tell, she is still obese. I bet she is still 50+ pounds overweight so I'm keeping my congratulations until she gets all the way there.

I'm so glad someone said this. It disappoints me that they've taken feminism and turned it into a joke. One fucking fat cunt said to me "You live in Australia, why do you need feminism?". Wow, sorry I actually care about what women in other countries have to go through. Fucking fats can't think of anyone but themselves.
The chick. She's way bigger in person too. The kind of fatty that's top heavy with tiny legs and a completely flat ass, like this: URL

Every guy told me that at work too - sex stops after you give her a kid, strip joints and burgers type bullshit. My wife and I have 18 years, top of our game / shape, and we have sex daily. Yes, daily. Our goal when we hit 40 in a few years is to look better than we ever have in our lives. She tells me about her friends who complain about "complications" in the bedroom.

That's literally almost 1.5 of me. How the fuck do you get big enough to let that happen?And the fucking hamplanet probably shrugs it off like, "it's *only* 140 pounds! I'm still a curvalicious babely cutie ^teehee !"
The winner is not pictured. This photo is full of loss.
Do you have to be muscular? Cuz I'm definitely a skinny fat lol. I'm thin, but I never work out, so no muscle. Can I still be verified? I've been scared to try and risk being banned from one of my favorite subs if I wasn't muscular enough :(
My crim decision making prof asked us this and everyone looked at me *giggling* knowing how I'd answer. Proud shitlady on and off the internet!
At this point Chris Chan is being manipulated by internet trolls posing as actual friends. While it all started rather innocent, recent events in his life have all been staged and planned out by a group of people who want to make him miserable and see how far they can push him. It makes me sick and I honestly can't follow the antics anymore. He is a mentally challenged individual that needs help he will never get and everyone around him is actually out to get him. Just throwing that out there.
A friend of a friend said I had 'a nice body but a butterface' once. It sucks but I'd rather go for a run than watch videos learning how to contour my face. I wear make-up, but not globs of it :/
It's why I like getting hate mail. They might as well put up a huge flashing sign saying “here are my insecurities please be gentle daddy". It's amazing what a couple of choice responses can achieve in terms of emotional damage.
thank god I have access to a full length mirror
Good up to 90 PSI!!!
Eh, we all know that this person has no interest in what we actually have to say, they just came here to poke us with a stick and run away giggling. And jiggling.
Spheres talking about rectangles and squares. Now, I have seen everything.
Do you also make fun of people if they hold up the line while waiting for their lotto tickets? Or the older people that still use checks?The only thing that bothers me when I smoke somewhere, is the amount of people that walk into a designated smoking area and give the smokers dirty looks. Other then that I openly joust any ham that desides to speak out about smoking while they are in line buying junk food. (to date I have cause a lot of yelling in stores over this.)
The thing that grosses me out, is they get off forcing and the food is all mushy or the ice cream is liquefied. It just disgusts me. I like feeling full, but not stuffed and they continue to eat.
Strength training also helps strengthen your bones, which is helpful post-recovery to fight off any wear and tear that could have occurred from vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Work with a physical therapist if you can and work together to see how far you can push yourself without damage.
Thank you for being supportive of my friend. He is an INCREDIBLE writer. He actually has his MFA in English I believe. I'm going to repost my reply to /u/dotzie here so it is higher up. He is the piece of shit asshole who has no clue what it's like to be an addict. To all the people like /u/dotzie - go fuck yourself. A. He's not married so idk where the fuck you're getting that. B. You have no clue what the fuck you're talking about you fucking ass. Two months of sobriety for a heroin addict is incredible. It's the only drug to cross the blood brain barrier thus is incredibly addictive. Two months of sobriety is like a lifetime and is an incredible achievement. I'm so goddamn proud of him and he should be lauded for his achievement. Believe it or not but heroin addicts are people too. Just because they're an addict does not make them a bad person or less of a person. Just because someone is an addict does not mean they're out robbing grannies or beating up kids for their lunch money to support their addiction. And OP is a GREAT person and actually worked to support his habit. He didn't rob people or steal or do anything illegal. He just worked and middlemanned. In the game, it is rare to come across someone that you would trust or care about or consider a friend and OP is one of those people. He is my friend first, and wasMy connect second. We hung out a lot, went to the movies, hell I even spent the night at his house a number of times. He could have robbed me a number of times, could have taken advantage of me when I was desperate but he never did such a thing. A number of times he actually helped me out a lot when I was short on cash and needed to get well. He would give me advice when I was having issues with my girl. He would encourage me to control my usuage and to make sure I put school first. So you can go fuck yourself with a rusty spoon you piece of shit. How dare you trivialize the incredible achievement of getting sober from dope. It is the hardest goddamn thing I have ever done and very very very few people are able to do such a thing. They're sick just like any other person. According to the DSM, addiction is a disease. It has basis in genetics that make certain people predisposed to addiction. I hope you get hit by a fucking bus, get prescribed powerful painkillers, get out of the hospital and realize that you cannot stop taking them no matter how hard you want to and switch to dope. Then slowly destroy yourself and not be able to save yourself like OP has. Then look in the mirror and blow your fucking brains out you fucking keyboard coward.
TIL donuts are a Quick &amp; Healthy Snack!
I went there in 2012, not that long ago.
/r/DiarrheaPockets.... Fuck you for this! Lol Wonder what she was on to ever think she looks "good" in this. *voms*
"I'll drink 1 of these a day."Oh, that 600 calorie soda. Just one of those a day. Yeah, that's normal.
Good idea. And maybe these quick-draw non-thinkers will actually pay attention to the big ol' wall of text explaining why this exists. "HURR DURR U R TAKIN SELFIES OMG UR SO NARCISISSISITCI" "Yes, that's the exact point."
Fuck, the fatties are in full force today. I didn't know they could do that many reps of mouse clicking.
Haven't you heard, it's FUNNY to put garbage on top of garbage and EAT it while thinking you're being cute! EFFYOURBEAUTYSTANDARDS Y'ALL!!
That drives me insane when they claim to be athletic. If your going to claim to be athletic you better be in the gym at the very least 2 days a week working your ass off.
&gt; Those who made themselves too fat to work can fuck off and lose some weight. *die right now
no its shit
looks like bender when he isn;t a robot.
Did somebody say LOGIC?
Don't worry, you're intelligent enough to weather it.
Oh no I definitely downvoted the ones you did as well! The post itself is what was being downvoted by fan boys.

How the fuck is that a bikini ?There's an inch of flesh between both parts. It's a technical achievement cut in half.
My wife is an RD/LD, you'd be surprised at how many in her field are obese.
"Till fat do us part."
So did I until I started going to this little gym. Every single day there's this gray/white old man who seems like he will never die. He is so incredibly fit and (crazy enough) almost attractive (I'm F/20). I have no idea how old he is, but he must be over 60 for sure, but damn he has a great looking body. Work hard old man! Such an inspiration.
Not trying to say the fatty is healthy. Just an fyi on gym videos. One person in the video is always doing the alternative "easy" version of the workout. It's meant to help you work around injuries or ease yourself into the lifestyle. That said. This cow probably jumped(figuratively speaking, of course) at the opportunity to do the easy version.
What? I can't stand people who purposely talk past someone else. Him: I do not support this.Her: Great, so I presume that you support this? Good on him. Children should never be taught that it's admirable to be fat. Teach them healthful habits and that bodies can be diverse, sure. Do not teach them this "intuitive eating" and "muh condishuns" crap. Kids don't always have the ability to recognize bullshit or facets of things and they don't need some tubbalard coming in and telling them it's okay to stuff their faces with whatever their body "needs" to reach their "set point" because oh well some people are just meant to be fat. How much actual science do you have to overlook to even think about bringing this into an educational institution?
Ah ok. Hams will do anything but exercise and/or go into a caloric deficit.
I read " I worked hard to lose 50 pounds last year" " This year bla bla bla excuse excuse excuse oh and excuse"
You cant fault the companies for finding an effective way to make money, but you can sure as hell fault the fatties for making the clothing industry the way it is.

I wonder how much faster TSA would be without hams... A shitlord can dream.. Imagine a world without hams taking 10 minutes to take off their shoes and arguing over whether or not they've been given enough peanuts. Sigh, if only.
I can only imagine some shitlords fishing, having a good time and all of a sudden BAM! Big ass lardwhale on your hook, gotta throw that shit back in the water before it sinks the boat.
Who knows what the fuck they wanna be called? Curvy, chubby, fat, fit, average, athletic.... they use them all and hate we anyone else uses them.
She looks like she guzzles Ranch dressing and sweats out Italian.
hate her, but she is not fatcalm down, just my opinion
At first I thought it looked like their fat enlarged heart
Yeah, my big sis is a nurse and she confirmed.
I would, but I feel like I wouldn't get as much use out of using it on guys as guys might on girls. Girls are sneakier, I'm not too proud to admit.
BLEACCHHHHHHHHHH!!! Eye bleach My eyes MYEYES!!!!!!!!!!
Wait I'm confused...what's fit about her?
It's more the fact that she considers it torture to go without.
I'd rather be old than fat. OH WAIT, fat people don't live as long either.
I've forgiven Michael Vick for what he did. He acknowledges his mistake and says he regrets it. His punishment was losing his job with the falcons, the disgrace, and the 3 years of his talent wasting away in prison. With that being said, I'm glad you own and know how to handle pits, let them live to 15+years with you.
Props for keeping on 4000 calories for that long. Tried bulking at around 4200 and it only lasted five days. Couldn't stuff my face like that for that long.
Just more proof that pandas ruin WoW.
That's a hell of a wake-up call, but it sounds like it sure as hell did the job. Sorry to hear about your uncle, but congrats on the shitfamily! It might take something similar for my family to wake up and smell the bacon... they love their food to much, and they get super defensive - there are some Munster fans in there - when I mention fitness to them.

Well, you are what you eat. In this case, pizza dough.
Not really "unhealthy offspring" because it's not due to condishuns and genetiks. More like "DO NOT MATE, INFERIOR PARTNER, WILL DIE BEFORE HAVING CHILD, UGLY AS FUCK." But yeah the children could be unhealthy because they emulate their lardass parents eating habits.
well I figured a bit of irony would be good in this situation. If they would just eat a little more broccoli they wouldnt have a broccoli top

&gt;Sounds like he had a good reason toYes, multiple head injuries explains this just fine.&gt;Yes, I'm sure you know better from what you read on wikipedia His 1995 biography by Carlo D'Este:&gt;It has been conjectured that in the final months of his life Patton was suffering the long-term effects of too many head injuries from a lifetime of falling from horses, and from road accidents. Various explanations have been offered to substantiate his increasingly peculiar behavior, including the fact that his prejudices became more open and virulent. While it is perfectly true that Patton suffered repeated and potentially serious injuries to his head (the worst of which was the injury in Hawaii in 1936 that resulted in his two-day blackout), and seemed to give the appearance of being punch-drunk, like a boxer who has been hit in the head too often, medical evidence to support the notion of a subdural hematoma is wholly lacking. &gt;Nonetheless, it seems virtually inevitable, as evidenced by his amnesia in Hawaii, that Patton experienced some type of brain damage from too many head injuries. The extent to which it influenced Patton's behavior will never be known.
Hell yeah!!!! I hit 300 lbs. Im looking to do those Ronnie Coleman numbers!!!

Glad you're back. Without you around there were hardly enough bans happening.
But, she's healthy. LOL
Her ass astounded me. 200+ lb per ass cheek!She literally sat there and the fat collected in that form over time. The human body fascinates me (and disgusts me).Now she's down to like 200lb or so
&gt; How can people be that weak and lacking in willpower to exist in that state when they hate it?They are easily discouraged. Many people, including fitness folk, don't really know much about diet and exercise (the fitness people spout "broscience") because the average person doesn't do any reading of studies but instead just listens to shit other idiots say. This is how fatties get discouraged they didn't lose 30 pounds in 1 week like the magazine promised, and they give up. They hate themselves and don't do anything because they feel *trapped* specifically. I can't say this is for all fatties, of course, but this is a common thing for many. It's not so much a willpower thing, but an ignorance that fuels being discouraged. This is cured by *reading a fucking study* and dropping fatlogic.
It'd be easier to poke em with a cattle prod and tell em to "git", but your way does sound nicer..

As far as I know, FPH is one of the most diverse communities on reddit. No mysoginy, no race hatred and definetly no antisemitism. I think it helps that we are all here for one reason and that we all support each other. I have seen RP guys be downvoted to hell as well as racist people (male or female)We are an equal opportunities hate sub. We hate you for the choices you have made and never for what you were born as. I would bet that this hambeast would hate a skinny jewish woman, actually let me correct that, this hambeast would hate ANY skinny woman.Fuck her, I hope she gets a heart attack soon.
That's why most don't use the word ''holocaust'', they prefer the hebrew word "shoah" meaning "great tragedy".This means that when some idiot accuses you of "denying the holocaust", you can claim in all honesty that you don't deny the "great tragedy (shoah)" and that the word "holocaust" is a dirty goy word that only lowlife scum use.

All I hear when these hammoths speak is **"I FUCKING LOVE CHEMICALLY ENGINEERED SHIT FOOD AND WANT HERCULEAN MEN TO WANT TO FUCK ME!!!"** Like, that is literally all they are trying to get across. Shut the fuck up, you fat fucking ham and go die in a beetus coma somewhere.It's also hilarious that they are worried about safety and not dying on a plane, but literally give no shits about eating themselves to death. I am pretty sure a plane crash death is a lot shorter and painless than an obesity-related one. Fucking. Idiots.
&gt;Boyfriend styleYeah, okay. Lonely lardass.
you feel like punching me in the face? bring it on you ***got. I know multiple fighting styles, and I also carry a switchblade with me at all times. Something ****ing tells me that you'd be better off keeping your arms down at your sides. If you can't ****ing put "cause" and "effect" together in that pathetic brain of yours, I'll help you out here. You'll be standing face to face with me, and let me ****ing tell you, it'll already be too ****ing late to back down at that point. You might decide "well ****, I might as well stay true to my word and throw a ****ing punch". This is where you will go wrong. I hope you don't have a job that requires two ****ing hands, because you're going to be missing one after I'm done with you. I'll casually divert your fist off to the side, as you suddenly realize you may have gotten yourself into something you can't back up. You'll try to regroup and pull your arm back, but that wont be easy when I jab my spear-pointed Benchmade switchblade straight through the bone in your forearm, and proceed to rip your entire ****ing forearm and hand off in one quick pull. At this point, you'll probably spend 2 seconds in shock. I say 2 seconds, because thats the amount of time you'll have before I reverse the knife in my hand, and uppercut it straight through your throat. You'll spend your last few seconds gurgling blood, and wondering where you went wrong. After that, I'll be forced to take care of any witnesses who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Nothing a few quick choke slams can't fix, followed by a nice gentle slice across the jugular with the Benchmade.Now, mother****er, you sure you want to go through with that punch?you really need to be careful how you talk about me on the forum, i dont appreciate it. tone down the disrespect, i dont know where you're from but where i am from, we dont tolerate that. dont even reply to this, just keep your mouth shut. consider yourself warned.
In an emergency fucking kick the fat over and walk over him, fuck that I aint dying because they want to be fat.
You've worked all your life and amassed a small fortune and you wish to buy a new car. Your first choice is a super eco-friendly sports car, great top speed, looks sexy and costs little to run... or the giant gas guzzler that costs 5 times as much to run and the parts wear out constantly, looks sluggish and is too wide to actually park it in public. Now imagine if this was an obeast... we all know an obeast can't fit in a sports car.
I guess I could see how that would be more problematic than just reporting them. Thanks for doing the Lord's work chasing off the fatasses.
ghostface always looks like an Italian-American man who got surgery to become blackdoes that make sense? He's just got a real old guinea look about him and it freaks me out
Does he mean the hippos or making fun of hippos! I need to know!
I despised exercise at one point too. Funny thing, when you're out of shape, exercise sucks. But it sucks a whole lot less than being fat or dying at an early age because you were too lazy to get your health in check.
Meh, I don't really have a problem with people with bodies like this. The girl looks fairly normal to me. Maybe a high normal BMI, maybe slightly overweight? The dude looks like he's in overweight territory, but I doubt he's obese.

Even when I see fatties eating something that is objectively healthy, they will eat such huge portions and use sauces/dressings in abundance. Portion control is so important. Never take nutrition advice from a ham.
Her?I'm honestly 50/50 on this game of "guess the gender." The fat has enveloped all distinguishing characteristics by this point.

Had this exact thought. Talk about massive narcissism and attention seeking behaviour.

It's difficult - on one hand you go around assuming everyone is a moron and people think you think you're better than they are. On the other hand, if you go around assuming everyone is able to think well then you will inevitably encounter idiots and crash and burn in a pit of despair. Personally, I think the first one is better but with a touch of 'some people are gonna be smarter than me' sprinkled on top. Still, be wary and always take an umbrella.
Or the metric shit ton of bullshit stories, like the one where the nearly-300lb girl was exercising 4 hours a week and on a strict diet, but couldn't lose weight...Nope. Nice try. GTFO.
I like the way you think.
And I thought I was depressed before, how the fuck did this guy get that. Fake confidence through the roof? Ultra rich parents? An emotionally damaged and low self esteem detector?I don't want to live in this country anymore, are there any English or German speaking nations, hell large areas where there aren't any hamplanets?
I think this is one of the best videos he's ever made. A lot of emotion and very real points behind what he's saying.Right up there with the Crossfit and Leg Day videos.
So, you have no idea you can lose fat working out?
Interesting. Are you a trader or is that a side thing? I'm a programmer. Well I manage programmers and do coding half the day. I can stand for email and the basic stuff but to truly get in the programmer zone I need to sit, throw on some white noise or light classical music and focus.

Pretty much just spit half the water I was drinking all over my monitor in laughter because I accidentally read:"I'm a goofball so let's see what ya got!" as "I'm a **golfball** so let's see what ya got!" thinking she was challenging people to roll her around.She's certainly rounded well enough to be one.
Fellow EDSer here, I'm type 3. How the fuck have her joints lasted with that weight, I'm almost as impressed as I am disgusted. I have literally woken up with dislocated joints from tossing and turning in my sleep for Christ's sake.
Fucking Malek. What a troll
I dunno, I think they might actually not be able to. If I added 100-150 pounds onto my back, I can probably still jump, but I'd feel very nervous about that kind of force on my ankles when I landed. If you don't have a good mind-body connection(and let's be honest, they probably don't) you can risk one foot landing a little skewed, and with heavy weight on top that joint is fucking done for when it inevitably rolls.Check your ankle privilege.
I'm confused, it seems like an intro to shitlording rant, not quite fph, but on the way.
Not yet,

My mother in law tells my husband im too skinny and that I need to gain weight. She wont say shit to my face though.
Props to you for aiming high, my high school crush isn't half as hot as that girl was.

you should accidentally spill something nasty on that blanket and offer to help her buy a new one.
&gt; I have actually been quite specific. Now, you're incapable of Googling the studies yourself. You have been vague beyond the limits of comprehension.It's not up to me to do your work for you. Show your evidence. I'm not talking about an article -- I mean the evidence CITED in the article! Primary sources, not secondary sources.&gt;Then I tell you about letters from survivors. Your response? "They could have been lying!" Some of them are verified to have been lying. Others "could have" been lying, obviously.Why do you believe that anything a holy survivor writes is automatically truth?Are you not aware of the wide range of absurd allegations that were made? These were angry and vengeful people repeating rumors that were going around at the time. The early testimonies, especially, are not consistent with each other, or with the physical evidence.Please compile and present at least a few strong, **specific** pieces of evidence as a self-post in r/holocaust.
I don't understand how these people are so narcissistic and so self loathing at the same time.
He deserves a reason to feel PTSD then...
Yeah I think her measurements are also wrong. Theres no damn way shes that low.

you're welcome!
Don't bother buying them. I asked my dentist and he told me to mix baking soda and hydrogen peroxide and just brush my teeth gently with that once a week or so. Tastes like shit but costs a whole lot less.
I like how she assumes that she'll instantly be hot, while at the same time hating on those hot skinny bitches.
why would she classify as medically unfit to work and hence receive benefits? Any weight over a 30 bmi should be deemed changeable, not beyond the persons control, so that even people with "genetic" conditions cannot receive benefits, because their is no reason to be that enormously overweight. People like this didn't exist 100 years ago. What does that tell you? She should have been denied benefits and hopefully struggled to find work, then couldn't afford food as much and hopefully lost weight.
I love that the cop's name is Hamm.
The worst part is some thirsty beta at the party will end up banging her anyway
That's decent progress
That's rough
Yea, and you can tell that's what she was aiming for too!
We hate fat people.
I finally realized why the "hurrdurr I'm hiking, therefore I'm healthy" thing drives me nuts. Standing in a garage does not make you a care. Going to school does not make you a good student. Hiking in a park doesn't magically undo the abuse on your body.
My step family has a guy who rides a scooter everywhere (and by everywhere I mean the liquor store). He probably weighs about 80 pounds. I could see that guy making it through the door to get into the McDonalds (probably because he wouldn't flip someone off when they open the door for him). Best guess, this hamplanet probably doesn't want to be made fun of eye to eye (or rather eye to ass). If she's cruising down the street, she's not eye to eye with anyone.
Idk why I browse fph first thing in the morning :s

She didn't miss at all, the bullet went through the vest. This is Darwinism at its finest.
&gt;What she did to get even will shock you....It probably will, because the correct response is "Fuck, I'm undesirable, and there's a simple solution to that."Her reaction was probably violent and spiteful, instead of comprehending that people have taste, and she no longer qualifies.

It's okay. They'll realize that not everyone is beautiful when no quality, attractive man approaches them for a relationship.
Ya sorry I got that feeling last night too but I was pretty damn tired so I went into argument mode. I do agree with you, the hustle to stay high is all encompassing and takes a shit ton of work. Haha glad you didn't just go off on me like most people would have on the internet. Hope you have a good day!
Thanks that makes me feel like I'm not missing out as much :)
Technically it could feed an entire school for a few weeks with its gut
Exactly. This is an entertainment sub too. And we don't need five squirts of butter between scoops in our popcorn.
It's like the rat story in Skyfall.
Oh, people can have opinions. They just can't have negative opinions about the fat tumblerinas.
I had not considered that. It's tantamount to the days i worked at an amusement park inside of a strip mall. Fat women would pull sweaty money out of their bra and place it down. It was so common we had a pair of tongs and a special drawer for that money.
The little girl is so scared of the beast, she is hiding her arms.

I dunno, but apparently I'm an anomaly because I lost weight and kept it off, which we know is impossibles, so I must not even exist.
Guess the bar or town and win a high five!

No ban but that is a fine line you're walking implying there are good fatties. So consider this a warning.

I think my favorite part of Fat, Sick (...) was when people would hem and haw, and then try it and be like, "Oh god this totally works". In the second one there was one guy who was nice but was basically like, "Yeah, this is bullshit. I like what I eat. I ain't changing." When he was revisited by the narrator it turned out he had started to change his diet and looked a lot better. He didn't drop loads of weight but he didn't look as miserable.

I have one. My Dr says is hip dysplasia, and that it will go away with surgery.
I realized the other day that, at least here, meat is actually really cheap. It's $0.11/100 g for a decent quality roast which I cut up and separated into freezer bags for stir fry. Dairy, on the other hand, is insanely expensive, as are breakfast cereals. My husband tried to argue with me that it's cheaper to get your daily calories from McBeetus than something like fruit. Well, I schooled him on that one and showed that apples, oranges, and bananas, just on a cost-per-calorie basis, are actually about half the price of a Big Mac. He actually didn't believe me at first. Honey, don't argue with the one of us who does the grocery shopping and the cooking. I know my shit.
Tragic. Hope shit like this motivates some hambeasts to put down the fork and work out before it's too late.
Except to someone pretending to be a bot, so fucking low.
Slightly fat to real fat.

I had some gall bladder/digestive issues about 10 years ago. I was only allowed liquids for about a month and a half. Ever since then, I can only eat small meals throughout the day. I don't know if I just started off slow, and my appetite just stayed that way, or if it's all psych. But I love it. I keep my calories low, and I can have small, healthy portions of food about 4 times a day. I dunno if it's that liquid diet's fault, but maybe these planets should try it! Or, I dunno, making that "pre-meal snack" an actual meal. A healthy one.
Wtf? Seriously? You sound just as bad as an SJW.EDIT: What the fuck? Why am I being downvoted? This isn't fucking stormfront. This isn't a sub for fucking racists. The whole reason why this video sucks is because it shows such blatent racism towards whites.

Women who think that men only care about pussy have nothing else going for them.

Good call, I myself like to call it the 80/20 rule...so no guilt. I eat whatever I want on birthdays, anniversaries, Thanksgiving, Christmas with the relatives, etc...Do the right thing 6 days a week pretty much...I don't own a scale. I can tell when my favorite pants are getting too tight, so: up the cardio a little (bikes/ walking/ etc) and cut back on the carbs/sweets...eat all the lean meat and veggies I can stuff down my pie-hole (so I am never hungry). I can easily drop 5 lbs in a month without keeping track, or sweating portions/calories/etc...I avoid sugary stuff, I was a sugar addict up until 18, went in the Navy, forced to eat healthier stuff the first year (boot camp, school) Then by the time I got to the ship and could eat what I wanted, I had realized I no longer craved sugar, and remembered how badly I craved it all the time.

I remember this trashy fat girl at my college got pregnant and I couldn't even tell. I found out later that when I saw her she was 7 months. She was just as fat as normal. The only change was that she held on to her belly more.Thin privilege is people knowing you are pregnant when they see yoy

Steel toe boots actually weigh a bit more, but most of these hams don't work in a place where those are necessary. And even then, 5 pounds on a 300 pound lard huffer won't shave more than a couple tenths of a BMI point at most. They're still fucking fat!

after all the hormone fuckery, no. but in the earlier stages, men generally store fat in their abdominal cavity, well under the skin and around their organs, where women generally just have it under the skin. after much hormonal fuckery, their estrogen (and body storage space) just makes it go under all the skin.
Well that was a hideous experience

"Neighborhood" FB groups are a thing in most cities. They are mostly comprised of people bitching about the most inane things. It's at least plausible.
Why aren't there posters like this for people?
Whenever there's a meal out with work or a friend's birthday meal where I know their other friends are fatties I will always skimp on food for a day or two, dress up as nice as possible and just eat a lot. I gym about 5 times a week and count calories so I can get away with it now and then. Of course, fatties don't realise this when they sit there seething, giving me evil glares when they think I'm not looking. Bitch, I can see you looking full in my direction and there isn't even anything behind me. I know you're looking at my slim body with your diet coke.
She will be soon. Don't worry.

aw ((internet hugs)) I'm sorry hon :/ Oh wow I had to google Oddworld, but it looks hella cool :3...yes, stale urine, fold cheese and yeastyness tends to pack a wallop judging by stories on here. I seriously cannot fathom how they are ok with the stank themselves, maybe being obese destroys the olfactory system :/
I go to the gym for 30 minutes 3 days a week. Thirty second rests between reps and sets only! I get about 40 reps altogether across exercises with the weights and equipment.
Wait... People think Barbie doll causes body issues? What about Bratz dolls then? Do they cause little girls to aspire to have an abnormally large head? WUT?
it's easy. they just play the "genetics" card. basically, every little aspect of your life boils down to genetics. it's not possible for them to be a healthy weight because their genetics don't allow it. this guy is dead because of reasons related to his genetics.it's insanity.
I believe some tumblrinas started using it to talk smack about us healthy folks, and we adopted it to spite them.
I love when fatties talk about starvation mode. I went through combat survival training (former military) and we had a whopping 4 MRE's between 8 people for 2 weeks. Talk about REAL starvation mode. I ended up losing 15 lbs (because I wasn't eating anything substantial) and I gained it all back once I got a solid couple days worth of meals in me. It's like magic or some shit...
Because it's a symptom of low self esteem, something a lot of us had in adolescence even if you were gorgeous. When you look like that, though...

Wow, taking care of cats and guinea pigs, both species which require minimal attention. That's some skill she has there, she should write it on her resume. The multiple number of these animals describes she's a lazy and secluded person who doesn't get out of the house and probably doesn't get many visitors either.As for putting people before her, more like going so slow that they all pass ahead of her. She should change that to "putting food on my plate before me".

Does this troll not know we love the fat hate. They don't realize we must be doing something right to hear the whalesong.
Our definition of a lifestyle change is not the same. The best way to lose weight and to keep it off is to change your lifestyle. Also, not all calories are created equally. Sugar is metabolized very differently than fat, etc. Also check out the thermic effect of food. You can eat 1500 Kcal of sugar a day and be one unhealthy skinnyfat fuck.
I was going to suggest 'lumpy' but this delicious sugar glazed shit lord beat me too it.Could I propose 'gunty' or 'FUPA'ry'

Funny you should bring this up. I was thinking about this today.I think there are three regular levels of food desire and consumption. They are; How much you want to eat, how much you can eat, and how much you should eat.1) How much you want to eat."OMG! I want to eat it all!"If you see something you totally love, this is the first reaction. It isn't a real desire to eat an entire cake (or gooey cheesy pizza, or whatever), just a general reaction. It looks so good and you just want to dive in.2) How much you can eat.Obviously, if you tried to eat an entire extra large pizza with everything, you probably wouldn't be able. Most regular people get uncomfortable with a severely distended stomach - which is just your body saying "slow down Tiger" - so they stop shoving food in their face hole.3) How much you should eat.This is what regular people do at meals. They might say "I'm so hungry I'm going to eat that whole fucking pizza myself - omnomnom" but when it comes down to it, they take their few slices and call it a day. They don't consistently gorge. Sure, they might for a special occasion, but daily meals are in line with what their body need to function properly. They are aware of the calorie in/out concept and they care about their health.With fatties, They only care about 1 and 2. They see that bucket of chicken and their greed and gluttony takes over. They have to eat it all. When 2 kicks in, they power through it, because they aren't satisfied until they have everything. They care about nothing else around them. Their health. Their toes. Their loved ones. Their children. They just want the chicken because they are greedy selfish fucks.Personally, I know how I am. I can be a mindless muncher. If I sit down to watch a movie, and open a new bag of chips, I would mindlessly shove chips in my face until I suddenly realize I've eaten too many or I start to feel sick. I know this about myself and know this is not something I should do. I remedy this by opening a bag of chips and putting the portion I will allow myself to eat in a bowl - then I put the bag away. How much I allow myself to eat is based on what I have eaten and what else I plan on eating that day (Sort of a mental calorie chequebook). Pretty simple solution.Fatties don't fucking care. They mindlessly munch their life away. Instead of a chequebook, they just max out their calorie Visa everyday. The problem with doing this is they pay the bill with their mobility. With organ function. With death. But they refuse to look at the future. They only care about their calorie credit limit.It actually makes me wonder what the average fatty bank account looks like. We have one gluttonous fatty at the office and I know for a fact he is consistently getting advances on his paycheque. I apologize in advance if this post is incoherent and rambling. I'm tired and waiting for a process at work to finish before I can go to bed.
I hate fat people, I don't hate people that are legitimately trying to better ~~their genetics~~ themselves. Fuck me, right?

I was on the road to be in nursing....until I happened to stumble upon this sub, and realized it would be ME who would be lifting fatasses all day, and essentially hurt myself to help people who don't give a shit enough to not eat themselves into a coma. I've changed my degree, and my sincerest apologies go out to you. Stay strong. I am so, so sorry that happened to you.

Over in Canada most of us (as far as I've seen) are very polite to wait staff even if they get an order wrong, unless your my mother. I wont eat with her at restaurants anymore. For me if my order is messed up I usually say "hey sorry to bother you man but they gave me [this] instead of [that] would you guys be able to switch it up? I know these things happen you guys are busy." personally I'd feel bad taking their food for free when its just a little mistake. My mother however will yell at the waiters, scream at managers and make a scene and blame it on everyone and demand free food. Shes not fat anymore (she got gastric bypass because she was too lazy to keep up with any kind of diet or exercise) but still acts like it constantly.
Oh my god I hate this fat cunt.
She's short enough to fit under an overpass. I question if she's narrow enough to.

Yeah but the delusion stems from believing that the majority (50%+) of women think they can get into a permanent/long-term relationship with guys that are in the top 10% (alpha, $100k/yr+, 6ft+, etc.)....which is mathematically impossible without polygamy.ONS are mathematically possible tho.
"I have strong legs"Nope.
Is this real life?This actually makes me really happy.
It cannot be done with PS, it would require a full mesh. The women in the pics still have the same thin facial features, but they have had extra weight added. Thinning a fatty in PS would still leave their fat, piggy features.
Yep.
Can confirm, have worked with obeast cadavers. Their fat deposits look like a mass of chunky curdled custard.
walkway privilege!!!(seriously, you're forced to jaywalk in places like where i live. i swear it's also a scam to get money for the state by busting jaywalkers. by not giving us legal walkways. fuck this world)

&gt; and they tried to touch the open area.This is creepy. People wanting to touch celebrities and people hotter than them in public without permission is disgusting. Fats talk about their right to their bodily autonomy, but the people I see always pinching and poking and invading other people's personal space are fatsos.
I knew it
They actually bought parachutes and rigged them into swim wear.Now, I know what you're gonna ask. "Well then who would sell them parachutes? They're obviously too big for it."It's because Mr. Shitlord Parachute Salesman wanted these fatties to jump out of a plane, knowing the parachutes would fail, causing them to crash to earth. Although, if they fell from the sky like that, it might cause the extinction of the human race.
when I first looked at it, tho, I saw a goose...paper towel roll is the eye, some black thing next to it is the beak, fupa is the fluffy body. it was a cuter picture than when I realized I was actually looking at a human body :(
Way hotter than the fat one though.
Fat privilege is being a certified flotation device in the event of a shipwreck.
I wouldn't doubt if you were right.
9 hours a week on the elliptical would burn a fuck ton of calories. Provided the Chipotle Manatees are not just standing on it. Provided they aren't compulsive liars. Provided they don't always over-report the amount of exercise they get. Provided they don't habitually under-report the amount of calories they intake.The list goes on and on.
That is absolutely 100% a fast food joint he's so nimbly escaping from.

Feel free to make another boring, predictable personal attack since that's clearly the method you use to feel less disempowered by your intellect's inability to cash the checks written by your emotions.
That comment has vote counts; how old *is* this?
She is absolutely a-ok according to HAES ...
I once tried to restore my faith in humanity by hoping she gained weight being lazy and the whole "gainer" thing is just her excuse for it.But I've been on this sub too long, and I know better
I like how she has a post on her tumblr about lazy neck beards when she seems to be the female equivalent
Reminds me of the time I accidentally sat in motor oil. Except those became my "shoveling horse shit" jeans, not my "go out in public" jeans.
haha, gotcha :)
I'd rather stay a virgin than even look at Tess' vagina
worst thing i've seen.I used to go on Reddit like every day. After seeing that, I drastically cut back.
Ofc hes super nice!! Girls always come to talk to him about troubles with their awful boyfriends! Hes always there to listen and give advice! But he just **cant** get that pretty girls to fuck him.... Why oh we are we such bitches? Why can we see through his ~~blubber~~ skin and see that ~~mountain dew~~ inner beauty in him?
We're all gonna make it bro. That won't happen, don't worry. Starting my cut in March. When are you starting yours?
i'm a slick nigga so i used a raekwon quote LoOOol
fatties are too stupid to realize that this is a joke, i honestly fear that some of them WILL go out and actually eat people.
Where can I sign up for that?
she seems like a nice person I don't see how she is this disillusioned though
Too many words = not funny = comment skimmed
My dad has had three bicyclists ride into him while he is making a right
This brought a tear to my eye. RIP Leonard Ball
Does that tattoo on her right flipper say "RAGE", or "RAGU"?
looks like i have to move.....my ex gf is like a midget to me D:
I didn't even know of this verification thing. I have been on phone so maybe that's why, but I'll check it.
Don't worry. They'll cut that tattoo off along with the necrotic leg.
She looks like she has Downs syndrome in the second photo.
Mods, we've got a rule 5 cundishun.
Thank you for doing that.
It's not "society" that deems your bodies disgusting, buttercup. It's cold, hard, uncaring BIOLOGY. Get that through your (literally) thick skulls already.
Same thing I thought. My mom's name is Tammy and she's a fat fuck too. Haven't met a skinny nice person named Tammy yet.
Oh, my God. She's my age. *She's my age*. I... I don't even know what to say.
That wasn't even the worst part. I didn't work weekends and she only wanted her husband to shower her so sometimes it was a week without her being clean. You don't understand what smells can come out of fat folds and smelly cooter/ass crack.
thank you so much, I needed to read that, all of it. I was so scared when they put me on seroquel (I'm currently on latuda) because motivation is already an issue and I didn't need potential weight gain added in there. things have been getting better, but they're not where I want them to be yet. knowing that there's well adjusted people out there makes this significantly better.
While I agree to a certain degree, what would be the reason that the obesity rates are so high in the southern states, which are also the most conservative states?
&gt;They are the center of their fat worlds,Due to their gravitational pull.
This makes an incredible amount of sense, did not think about her "at least 4 marathons" being just an annual sum total. I've run a "marathon" in the past two and a half weeks by that hambeast logic...
waaaaiiiittt a sec. I think I know that bowling place. Is this in melbourne australia?
They're not even attracted to slugs though, they just loudly proclaim how sexy fat is and then turn around and demand that fit, hot guys/girls fawn all over them. When they don't, it's because of "the media."

Theres just something about relationships that make some people want to hit the local fast food joint as quickly as possible.
True story. I once knew a guy that owned a dive bar, and he was diagnosed with Da Beetus. He ignored his Doctors advice and wound up getting a couple of toes amputated. He walked around on a cane for a while (still drinking like a fish in the bar he owned) until they took his whole foot, resulting in his being confined to a wheelchair. Now, for most people you would think this would be at the least a wake up call, but no; my boy got himself a top of the line Hover Round Chair and, you guessed it, kept drinking. Well, I'm sure that you can see where this is going, and you are right; he had to get BOTH legs amputated below the knees. The last I heard of him he was still drinking, but suffering major complications. I believe he is dead now. Stupid fuck.
Ho-lee shit. Did not expect that

Ehhhh haha. Nailed it.
Yeah, when their BMI is 24.9 or less. Or they look like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Fine by me their weight is just an addition to a long list of things they do that make them sexually unattractive.
They mean lifts that are made for car engines. Not that it has a mechanical engine.
Wonder how did she make a baby. Human boxy is amazing
They should sell obese people the nosebleed seats so they can't block peoples' view of the game.
Dinosaurs have big bones.
There can be no beauty in front butt (or any fatty), only anguish, sadness and the odor.
He looks so bovine in that leather jacket.
On some level they realize they are pathetic but in an attempt to get attention, they create a fictitious victim complex by hijacking real problems. I was severely anorexic for a long time so hearing them talk about their eating disorders pisses me off in the same way that them talking about "trigger warnings" pisses you off. They trivialise serious issues to make themselves like real victims.
Wtf, yeah that is one *weird* looking forehead.
Holy hell mate! I had the same shit happen to me. I went from a semi from a BJ to pants off and me flying at no mast. I couldn't even get up to finish the BJ from the smell. My cat started meowing at the door like she does when I open a can of tuna.
No boobs (small boobs) are okay on thin girls, imo.Personally I prefer an amazing shaped ass to big boobs.
It's probably plastic.
Probably nothing considering she's the whales daughter
$10 says they'd clog the black hole. Willing to lose $10 to find out.
Dang thats true. I hadnt thought of that. The Empire truly is us, the shitlords.
I had to paste that into Word to increase the font size to see that it said "Teehee"LOLEDIT: Sorry about your pretzels. I don't have them here so I don't know what you missed out on BUT at least you learned to never leave food unattended around Fatties. Recipe for ~~disaster~~ disappointment.
He must have been adopted. Clearly he does not have her genetics.
That pose in the second one OMG.
It is Wal-Mart shopping bags. It's fun for us to go there and make fun of 'people'.
Looks like she's trying to get some food out of his mouth.
Before you all jump down my throat, hear me out: I used to sell these.I worked a retail job and since I had just moved over a thousand miles from home, I didn't know anyone. I had been okay the first few months and then started to realize I didn't have anyone to really talk to outside of my husband and he was being deployed soon.So when the cute petite coworker with great hair asked me to come with her to a vendor fair of course I said yes.Now I'm from the midwest, and have been told by my East coast dwelling friends that I'm a giant pushover because of it.So it was no surprise when I was eventually roped into "selling" these. I say "selling" because I didn't actually put any money into it and didn't actually have any sales.Giant women would come up to my booth looking so hopeful and ask me all sorts of questions and I didn't use these stupid things so I couldn't morally vouch for them. The coworker I was working with always got on my case to just lie to them and sell them shit but I never did it.I can confidently say that the people selling these don't believe in them and all the preaching on social media is actually pre written and sent to us to just copy paste.I'm still technically a seller so if any of you want over-priced vicks lotion on a piece of paper or cheap ass biotin on sale for only $55 hit me up ;)
I think they *do* realize that being fat is bad and bad for them. That's why they're so vocal about being "beautiful" and "healthy" and all that other happy horseshit.
Makes the beer taste worse, and then the pizza taste worse. Clever.

Speaking of her eyes, why on earth would she line them in black like that? Makes them look freakishly tiny. I don't know that much about makeup, but I still find myself baffled by so many hammies' makeup choices.
What, no gift card to McDonalds?
Well, she's not completely wrong. The conversion rate in this case is 1 American = 3 1/3 normal people.

She's a beautifull independant womyn in the wild.
Yep, it's pretty awful. Both seasons. Apparently there's filming going on right now for a "Where Are They Now?" documentary. I'd be interested to see how many put all the weight (and then some) back on. Let's make it a new statistic.
Geez these people are thick. These two words don't rhyme for everyone! How is that a difficult thing to understand?
They make sneakers in extra-wides though
I wish Tess would just go to a doctor for an physical exam and blood tests, then post her results online just to show everybody how "healthy" she really is. But I know that will never happen or they will just come up with some other excuse for her poor results.
I have a vagina.
spot the new guy
This looks like Toronto.
I've heard bullying can get pretty bad in the field too. Bet it has something to do with the fit nurses vs the fat ones.
Fuck off with the racism.Banned.
It's a sad day when you get so fat you have to hold your whole arm out to fit your giant fucking head in a selfy.
There is no way a 1 year old would shove rocks in her vagina. I have 3 kids and I have pulled some weird things out of weird places on my kids, but never once did they insert anything like that. Someone had to show that baby something I don't even want to think of what or who did it. This whole story just reads very very wrong to me. It makes me sad. Sexual exploration is natural and healthy, this incident was neither.
I hate this. I'm also very short so at some places my feet don't touch the floor, making it even harder.
won't you love me even when i'm an embarrassing drunken slob? if i get blackout drunk at your company's Christmas party and kiss your boss, you'll still love me, right? it would be abusive for you to say anything bad about that behavior...
I know a vet who insists that perfectly healthy horses with good muscle coverage and no visible ribs need to gain 60-80 pounds. Because "fat horses are healthier than skinny ones". He's not a fat guy, so I don't get why he has this harmful mindset. Of course, he's an idiot who should not have a single client, in my opinion. Preferring his clients' horses are overweight is just one of his many faults.
lol
He is a fucking idiot. Say whatever constructive comment you'd like. You added to the overall discussion.
&gt; How do women like this think it's acceptable to wear a ~~two piece~~ bathing suit? There should honestly be laws against this. It's just indecent.ftfy

[Ah, here we go, use this to keep you strong the next time you feel like being nice to a fatass.](URL
Gainzzzz.
Is this a movie? Please be a movie. I don't wan't to believe that our standards have sunk this low. Isn't there a fitness test you have to pass or something.
imagine if every time a doctor r nurse had to work with a hamplanet they lost a week of time.
ugh every time i try to contemplate the physics of it and every time i get physically ill. i should know better by now
I recommend adding in body fat percentage to that. People LOVE picking apart BMI because a body builder and a hambeast can technically have the same BMI. Strongman Hafthor Bjornsonn has a BMI of 43, but so would a 5'10", 300lb fatty.
Spotted David Mitchell on the far right.
I just got hate-mail too! Copied and pasted below:**fuck you**from d**********h sent 3 minutes agoApparently you don't understand the difference between unfounded hate theory and confirmation. I am text on a screen. I could be an elderly Dutch man or your own mother. You have no clue as to who I am or what I look like. Arguing with hateful cocksuckers and circlejerkers for hating on fat people does not mean I am fat, it just means I righteously despise hateful people of any kind for any reason. You people are nothing but the KKK or the Taliban or Isis.
You are mad at fatties, yet fat you beThis is the bullshit we hate, the hypocrisyBanned you are piggy until you drop some poundsKnock off your fatlogic and those blubbery soundsIf you need to shed weight, do it dont tarryFor having extra fat is a burden to carryNo where near a hambeast is a dangerous excuseYour fatty entitlement in FPH is of no useBanned you are, come again when in a human bodyYour understanding of our rules is really quite shoddy.
You are such a shitty person. It is ok to judge him on his perfect teeth, perfect hair, and nice guy soul (even though he doesn't seem too nice the way he attacks fit guys he doesn't even know), but you CANNOT judge him on his being fat, or his being deceptive and delusional about it!Good post!
Pics, I need something for the ole wan.. science bank.Seriously, I'm having a hard time imagining this.
Haes is a feminist issue because as feminists we should be fighting for body autonomy which means promoting independence, healthy living, and health education with proper medically accurate scienfitic facts not cow toeing to mega corporations selling us a version of health that keeps us sick and in a position to consume more
I think OP's talking about the crazy exaggerated, supersharp lip shapes fatties love to draw. [Here's](URL
I've lived in Ireland and the US. The US is far, far bigger.
You know what would be so awesome? If instead of straight dying from clogged arteries they amputate and she keeps repeating the cycle and ends up a stump before she learns "hey maybe butter wasn't the best choice for a snack"
I was talking to my sister today and she mentioned that her bf is getting chubby because he likes eating too much.I said, bitch everyone likes eating. Fat asses make it sound like they enjoy food on a deeper level like a 13 year old thinks its "deep" for listening to the Beatles.
I think a lot of those responses are from guys who want an easy blowjob.
Are you saying it's not the fat persons fault themself??
this was the most accurate gif I have ever seen...
I'll eat beans sometimes. I think it's more a moderation thing but yes! We can definitely talk about it :)
What is it with fat chicks and tit bondage? All over that whale porn sub
I can't remember the name of it for the life of me but it's a thing and back then they wouldn't have had any idea what to do with their freaking out child.Or...they're shitty parents and they fed him too much.
It has nothing to do with bikes. It was a design choice, the wider the door is, the smaller the chairs (two on each side of the train, in second class) have to be. So this is a middle ground between seat width and gangway width.  There are a few parts of the train with double doors BTW, to accommodate for wheelchair users.
Homophobes love to point out when a gay guy is intolerant of something. It's almost like we're people who do people things, and they need the entire world to know it.

How many of those replies were whining fatties claiming discrimination?
Didn't manage to get a pic, but I saw an obeast get her fupa stuck between two train doors in NYC. Was busy prying the door open so it could get out. Before being a shitlord, I'd put a higher priority on setting an animal free.

I had never seen or read anything on TITP. It's exactly as idiotic as I thought. "...in my opinion the modern conception of ‘health’ is bullshit." She states that but doesn't bother to provide her own definition. Just calls bullshit on the idea of health. Have a heart attack already.
I think the fashion industry has some twisted ideas about what is normal or plus sized to be honest. Yeah Tess monster is gross but this woman just looks average sized not plus sized and a lot of models look skinny to the point of being unhealthy. But I'm not a doctor and it's sure as hell better than promoting obesity.
Remember, the sun can only shine on one side of planets each day, so there have to be some dark sides. You just happened to catch them all at the same time...
My favorite way to sit is all curled up in a chair with my feet under my butt... I was thinking about how much it would suck to not be able to sit the way I wanted and be comfortable. Even through both of my pregnancies I was able to sit this way. I... just can't imagine being fat. Besides being foul and unhealthy it's super inconvenient. I wonder if they realize how by being lazy fat fucks, they are actually making MORE work for themselves.
I was a fatty and I abhored the idea of someone going out with me when I was a fat. I refused to get involved with anyone until I has taken care of my own problems and not had that stupid baggage. If I started dating someone and got into an LTR and they gained weight I don't care if it's a 5 or 25 year relationship they're done. It's gross and sites that they don't give a fuck about their own body. How am I supposed to love and share my life with someone when they can't do the activities to keep up or they die?
That would be amazing...I'll consider the best way to go about this! I often wonder what goes through their minds... If you are asking people for $10,000, don't you think you'd make every effort to make their money/investment worth it? I refuse to believe they were never told by their doctor that losing weight would help. This just goes to show how selfish they are, which theyー and their legion of fat enablers ー will never see because "creating a family" is such an important "commandment" from their God for this ReligiHamily. Do the world a favor, if you can't conceive children because you are too fat then lose the weight, get healthy first, and if you *still* can't have kids then forego the expensive fucking IVF and use that money to adopt a kid and start a college fund for them or something else that matters. The world is not going to end because you don't pass along your nasty genetics ー and remember you believe you are fat because of your "genetiks" so why are you trying to pass along your shit DNA in the first place?
Imagine the shitlording at old age - people can't say shit about you because you're obviously doing everything right, they can't really argue too hard, because they will look like assholes and you're free to express more hate because you get the old man pass..
This is what bugs me about HAES. There is this cry of 'how dare you not find me attractive!' to people who...take care of themselves and are what people think is attractive! It irks me that they bitch and moan about people not wanting to fuck them, but they pick people who are hot!You can't force someone to do something JUST because you want it, you know? Just bothers me.
Well, i have once outweighed a guy who was 5 inches shorter than me (whom i casually dated)... he was really skinny as well. But it's a rare thing to happen. Shorter guys can't change their height, lardasses can lose the weight.
Thanks for clearing that up, my bad!

It's a testament to the adaptability of the human body that a stomach can stretch enough to accommodate all that food when it was only meant to hold about 16oz.
Yeah, that's the point. They don't have to put forward any effort.
Why does she deserve it if it's a waste of time? Of course they should deny her. Let her spend her own money at a private place instead of abusing our healthcare system.
It should absolutely be child abuse to raise a fat child. If starving, beating and molesting your child is child abuse there's no reason whatsoever not to include overfeeding them to the point of obesity to the list.It's amazing how people can talk shit about an athletic, very lithe young girl and how she should be fed more but calling parents out for their butterhuffer stroke-by-30 child is unacceptable.
Yeah, back when I still went to a gym, I viewed 95% of the other patrons as people paying for bullshit to subsidize my lifting.Then I went and put a rack, barbell, and bumpers in my garage, and I don't have to worry about the other people at the gym anymore :)

yeah but in reality in a SHTF situation outdoor skills and basic fitness will serve you way better than having an AK 47 and 3 other guns plus a collection of machetes. Ideally you want a good knife, string, traps, fishhooks, fire making stuff, compass, good hiking boots, a book, first aid kit, and perhaps a light rifle like a 22 or a mini 14. :P
To me, saying eating is only for nourishment is like saying sex is only for reproduction. It's not to many of us and that's okay too. I love every aspect of preparing food (choosing a dish, buying the ingredients, cooking, eating, sharing it with loved ones). I've never cried over it, though, and that's where people go wrong. There is nothing wrong with loving food (neither is there with considering it just fuel).

I suppose you're right, but I think OP is well within the range to make my original joke work. Even if "scrawny" is not close to the right word, a thin build works too.
this is EXACTLY what i was trying to say in another post and i got fucking shit on for it(maybe i didn't word it out the gate the right way but whatever)...i wasn't saying her body was hot, but it really really angers me when such a beautiful face just throws the rest away like why, just why.

Whatever you do, don't marry him. He'll drive you crazy over dinner every single night and eventually he'll be fat.
That is just so much fat I don't even.... Christ. It's so lardy the gurney(s) left an imprint!And all that extra adipose just sticks and clogs up the rest of the internal organs. I remember my cousin's hubby doing his residency in surgery and they had to cancel what would've been a life-saving transplant why? Damn thing was caked with enough fat to grease a pig, which is probably where it came from too.
kay, show me your recent bets then, if you've got the need to brag about it :-)
ROFLMAO :face_with_tears_of_joy:
made an account just to reply to this since i mostly lurkjesus man it sounds like you have some stuff against women and this girl in particular but that's the state of our culture right now, she isn't some ancient evil succubus fooling men into making her famous, she's just one of the many people who got noticed by the spastic eye that is america's mainstream internet culture.I get the jist of most of what you said before you went all time cube theory; a lot of people who post on this subreddit are pretty misanthropic or bitter about their current situations but never seem to decide to change their formality or improve their situation, which IMO can only lead to a spiral of blaming others for your problems as you get older and more sedentary (e.g. starting with "parents never payed for my college money so i'm in debt" to "the jewish NWO is working against me" if it's worth anything to you or anyone else reading this, my philosophy is that I can always get so abstract and nihilistic about the concept of "purpose" or any deeper meaning that I can't really say I have any, rather I think it's important that we - whether it's all MDE fans or all people in general - should strive to become the best and most successful variations of ourselves given the cards we're dealt, so that if we happen upon something that we truly have a passion for or think is worth fighting for, we'll be in a position where we'll be willing to give truly our all to it. I think the current systems of government (bear with me here when people start saying phrases like that they usually accompany them with crazy shit but give me a chance on this) aren't designed for many people to become truly successful in any note worthy way, this is why we have the "american dream" which is just a house and 2.5 kids, a standard we place on to every one of the nearly 350 million people living in the USA, not caring that nearly every human life has vast potential (barring like paraplegic mentally handicapped guys i mean it sucks but hey roll again i guess) just stemming from our brains being self aware and blank slates when we're growing up.  yes that means the black guys who played chief keef on the bus you were on, yes that means the jewish guy who complains too loudly about his order at mcdonalds, there's nothing showing any race different from yours has anything so drastically debilitating in their brain chemistry or genetic make up that they don't have merit as a human that we couldn't just resolve with some near future eugenics or gene modification, (sidetracking for a moment but even if we found out for example all black dudes have an automatic 10 less IQ why would the first response to that be "alright let's fourth reich up and segregate them or kill them" we have fairly smart people being put into worker drone positions all the time at least a less intelligent person reaching their full potential is reaching it at all most people can't even say that for themselves) but i dunno really what i'm saying here except for to take that not everyone who visits this subreddit is some stormfront infowar jew hater who is planning on riding on their obesity and "hurt leg" for disability checks for their remaining 35 years of life. Even if you're not funny like Sam or have some crazy creative talent to show off, you could just find something you're really good at that makes you happy and then support people you vibe with like MDE.Or if you really want to get extreme about it get a good job and start doing stocks and make enough money that you create a NWO out of fellow MDE fans and call yourselves "The Sons of the Patriarchy" i mean fuck it if you're gonna die eventually might as well spend your life trying at some crazy shit instead of getting mad and blaming other peoplealright my big rant is all done does anybody else ever feel like they're satisfied with their worldview but really self conscious about it like i feel like one day i'm gonna talk to someone about this and they'll be like "ah yes your beliefs tie in mostly with the "russell brandian" school of philosophy many fourteen year olds believe the same things as you i recommend looking into some of criss angel's philosophical writings or a retard helmet"
Source?
No helmet, no back protection. Don't worry shitlords, this one won't last long.
The bitch that wrote this should could kill herself. I couldn't even get all the way through.
It would probably be more accurate to correlate all of those to income than to each other.
These are things that can easily be changed. Their weight requires actual work.
Honestly "metro" is a just a word that guys who don't know how to dress call those who do. Oh, you don't dress like a five year old? How "metro."No, the word you're looking for to describe the person in this picture is "cunt."
If this is the post that offends you, then this probably isnt the subreddit for you. This is fat people HATE. Doesnt matter what their profession is, fat is fat. And to me, this particular profession should be all fit people. I wouldnt want some fat tard caring for me when they cant even care for themselves.

I've never understood a mentality that absolutely cannot be happy for another person. Her cousin lost weight? Good for her. Why not just be happy for her cousin or use it as a wake-up-call/motivator to better herself instead of crying about it?
and this one URL
I'd point a finger at the fat shaming here but this is the first time I've heard the word 'obeast' and wow, whawhawhat a fafffafantastic word. Also nobody likes a complainer.
Yeah, didn't mean to get all evangelical on you.
I got the idea when sending my verification pic to the mods. The mandatory "here's the Shapire in my pooper" title gave me the idea.

She's not claiming to have a perfect bmi. Let me fix it for you. "who cares? I, for one, don't. Be fat, be skinny, have the perfect bmi, whatever that is, but the most important thing is be happy... "Not defending her, of course, there's enough fat logic in here for me to feel completely justified cheering for this person to spontaneously combust and burn in her own lard, but let's criticize her for what she actually spews out of her fat mouth, not what we think she is trying to communicate to humans.
I don't get it, why is there a picture of two gorilla statues on this sub?
The very premise of the study talked about in this article is flawed. Who gives a fuck about individual experiences with obesity and their opinions on how difficult it can be? There's only one question: is being overweight healthy? NO. It's an objective fact at this point. Everything else is fluff. Being overweight is objectively, demonstrably harmful and it should be prevented at all costs. Starting from that foundation is the only way to approach this topic and actually hope to better peoples' lives.
Why must they take (and narrate) dozens of weird-face photos of themselves? That was rhetorical, kind of.
Most of the "times".Augh, the bad grammar!
It does.
Because the hunt demands it... now stand back while I make a fatty mating call, and make sure you check our six. BiiiiGMAC! BiiiiGMAC! Kentuckyfriedchicken!
Claims to be a 22, realistically probably a 26-28.Claims to be 260lbs, realistically probably 300-350lbs.Smooth skin in photos, in reality she's covered in cellulite.

Man, what a blow that must have been. She looked like the youngest girl from "Party of five" in the first couple, and then full blown hambeast!
Rest In Pizza. The Japanese claimed another land whale.
yea, that number seems off, at 5'7" 135 I was not huge in terms of muscle and managed a six pack
This infuriates me. As the girlfriend of a type 1 diabetic I just want to scream at this person. My boyfriend is possibly the healthiest person I know. He takes such good care of his body, works out, eats only healthy foods, lays off sweets and sugars ad refuses to drink alcohol. Ive seen him eat a slice of cake once, while still regulating his insulin, and end up going too high anyways and having a panic attack over it. he has nightmares of people taking his insulin away and watching him die slowly over high blood sugar or same for food and watching him suffer from low blood sugar, and here this fat fucking piece of crap is just teeheeing her way through a preventable fucking disease that my boyfriend doesn't get to have disappear because of good eating habits. The worst part? people like that make it difficult to GET sugar if you don't have emergency supplies if he slips into hypoglycemia. While we have snacks that help him out when he doesn't want to eat, drinks are the fastest way to get sugar back into the blood stream. now a days you can't run into a place and say "my boyfriend has type 1 diabetes and I need something sweet like orange juice to help him raise his blood sugar before he passes out. NOW. I NEED IT FUCKING NOW." Im always scared they will think its a hoax because so many people pretend (I have heard of people saying they have low blood sugar to get free stuff before, no joke) and they won't give him what he needs to survive. just...fuck that thing.
Pictures like these piss me off because if someone like me, who is mildly thin, were to post a picture of me just in my underwear and shirt doing shit like this I would get a bunch of people either hating on me or asking me why I'm bragging about myself or showing off, while people like her are practically praised for doing the same thing, and it is just so unfair
THERE ARE NO TVS IN THE OCEAN, SHITLORD.
I know what part of the body it's supposed to be, but I can't figure out the gender.
Alright, alright, alright
She and her ham hubby both look like they'd have a tendency to throw their weight around.
Only desperate fuckbois will stick their dick in her mouth.
So it begins.....they r slowly rebuilding society to cater to fat cunts.....u win tess cuntster and ragan.....mcfaty sigh let us shitlords find a new planet to live on and if people become fat we gut them for fule who's in?
&gt; tipping *appropriately* is one of the first things to go.FTFY15% in the US is a minimum tip.
Dang, that's a fivehead if I've ever seen one.
Je naam is een goed begin, nu je flair nog :)
And why does she look constipated and all of the photos?
Everyone in that pic looks fat... Stay strong you magnificent shitlord.
That sub used to be amazing when it was small. Now it has all the political correctness of twox before it went default. I hate fatties, their sensitivity, and their inability to make and take jokes.
A: Be present.
I was thinking the same, lol. She looks horrible. So much wasted potential...
Ton. They meant ton.
Yeah, my family went through a rough time when my dad got laid off when I was a kid, we ate so many vegetable soups and stews. Always delicious and cheap :)
This is what killed the dinosaurs.
I hate cutting diets. I can eat chicken and rice only so much. But summer is worth it. Oh sweet beach.
Didn't even bother looking, just saw the traditional "let's judge your body" comment x3 my apologies
Nah, just thought you might because of the username reference.
Sad when it's easier to tell their sex from their bone structure than their outline.
"Sorry I'm not made of sugar" is from adventure time. As a anime/comic nerd myself, I see way way wayyyyy too many of these monsters at comicon. Why do they think they are such hot shit? Even comic nerds don't like them. My poor fiancé is hit on by some whale in a walmart corset every time we go. It is always the same."Teehee!!!! Asian guys like white girls right? Are you japanese?!?!? Can you call me kawaii?!?"Then when he informs them that he is chinese, and is here with me. They get all pissed off and tend to say things along the lines of "well Asian guys have tiny dicks anyways!"You fat cow. You are so thirsty you would take any fucking dick thrown at you.
Thank god it isn't 6 out of 6 or worse.
[This was by far the best video of her sloppy mouth](URL
No one should encourage unrestrained unhealthy lifestyles.
Fat was attractive? What the hell was the corset designed for then?
I love how at 3 :33 the second planet in orbit is talking about her shoes and says: "I'm just going for comfort. That way, if I get a little drunk and fall, I won't break my ankle."Little does she know, it's more likely going to completely detach at the ankle.
Oh my god that Boston one. I wanted to go to the Vegas one. The blazing 110F heat is usually enough to keep them in doors. I was busy anyway.
Kicking that would be like kicking an underinflated beach ball.
I once gave a cute twink a piggyback ride at a club. I think he weighed about 100 lbs. It was really fun, and he loved being up so high.

They actually weren't allowed to keep half of Europe. The Yalta Conference specified that Poland, for example, was to be organized on democratic terms. This, after Stalin sat by and watched the Home Army get crushed after provoking the Warsaw Uprising. They invited the Polish government-in-exile back, immediately sent them to Lubyanka prison, convicted them in show trials, and sent them to gulags. The Lublin government was an obvious puppet regime, and the West was outraged at the betrayal. The New Dealers and their "Mission to Moscow" were completely duped, it was pathetic.

I always find this dude hilarious, and I forget about him completely until someone else brings him up.
I'm fine with being wrong. I just am surprised fake boobs can look this real. I have seen quite a few bare boobs, both fake and real, and usually it is obvious. The main reason I think these look real is the way they flow naturally down from her shoulders. Also, they seem to be "hanging" slightly, the way real boobs do when unsupported. A little further down her chest than fake boobs usually sit. Again, I am fine with being wrong. I just haven't seen fake boobs that look this real before.
If you're a UK size 10 I'll bet my firstborn you're not a 36 Anything. Your underbust is probably around a 28-30. That's your band size.
Because that will accomplish nothing. Their end goal isn't change or self improvement, they're too lazy for that. They want to be a disgusting piece of shit and force everyone to accept that and call them beautiful. Wasting time conversing with them grants them undeserved legitimacy.
Trigger warning plz
They would have to be human. Not a fat piece of shit.
I really like this comparison and on a related note, I think the way fat people treat diet foods is similar to the way a lot of people spend money during a sale. BTW, I'll be the first to admit that when I see 50% off, I usually do end up spending about the same amount of money I would spend if there weren't a sale - but I leave with twice as many shirts or pants than buying full price.However, fat people apply this same logic to food, and it just doesn't work. Try something that has "half the calories" as the normal version, low fat, etc. and they just double their intake which "saves" them nothing and only makes them expand slowly like the universes they are doomed to become.
They give shadow on summer and warm hugs in winter :)
Her husband (they deserve each other) must be wearing the absolute largest-size Santa hoodie he could find, which I'd think would be a wakeup call.
your mother is a sad sorry creature. I am also disgusted with the overwhelming outcry of foul play when one spouse leaves another because they find their complete lack of care for their shape largely sexually unappealing if not completely revolting. "How dare they have such high standards, love is unconditional!" - except that nothing comes without conditions and nothing comes without being earned.
There is no faking being a fatty.
You seem to be in the wrong subreddit
Me and my girlfriend were having sex a little while back. she's on top, i'm on the bottom with my feet hanging off the bed and on the floor. (for reference, we're both 5'9'' and in great shape). I gently push her back so she's sitting up on top instead of laying down. i sit up too, grab her ankles and stand up with her. I'm literally only holding her by her legs while she has her arm wrapped around behind my neck while i'm still inside her and bounce her up and down. I can keep this up for a few minutes and when we get back on the bed I'm not winded, i can keep going. the complete and utter look of surprise she had on her face was eclipsed just as fast by the approaching orgasm. this is why i squat. this is why i deadlift.
It's the most exercise they have had in ages
No. Not that big of a tech company. Google actually has a lot of health-conscious stuff. They have their own chefs and kitchens that serve decent meals.
I never said being obese was = child rape but you're a pretty stupid whore, so I don't expect you to understand. I guess a cumbucket like you probably doesn't know what a simile is. Here let me help you.simile:nounplural noun: similes-a figure of speech involving the comparison of one thing with another thing of a different kind, used to make a description more emphatic or vivid (e.g., as brave as a lion, crazy like a fox).Try again cunt.
That would be the most awesome job, ever! I've never been to a club like that before, I'd be terrified that they wouldn't let me in for being ugly. How can gigantic beasts delude themselves, I'm person-sized and still fear rejection!
Because the overwhelming majority of this HAES trash comes from fat women
You should have beat him within an inch of his life and called the COPs. I'm pretty sure they aren't lenient in S. Korea with fat-fuck foreigners raping their women.
It would be so tragic to finally get it unlocked after having to tow it to be re-keyed just for it to be dead. Well, at least I'll be able to get the diapers out of the car.

The body doesn't look *that* bad. A tad heavy but I don't like toilet pics and her face is weird.
30+ minutes? Try closer to an hour. It at least takes a modicum of effort to run a 5k in 30 minutes. That's under 10 min/mile, and the chick in this photo is most assuredly not capable of hitting anywhere near that number. I will never understand paying the cash and then shuffle walking a 5k. I've gone to more than my share, and I've seen people just strolling across the line at over an HOUR at the speed you and I would window shop at a mall. I've also seen these assholes get shitty when they start breaking the finish line down at the hour mark. The entitlement is just galling. For some people, a 5k is a celebration of their efforts to lose weight and get healthy. Nothing wrong with that. But if you're strolling along like you are inspecting cracks in the pavement, go fuck yourself. The volunteers didn't sign up to deal with your lazy ass.
You, you are my fucking saviour.
I think so too, honestly. If I remember correctly, the fat antagonist refers to the author as a "skinny bitch" a few times, which made my bullshit-dar shoot through the roof. I get that FA's and shit believe that anyone who isn't obese is skinny, but that author *is* obese. She is not at all skinny, and no fat person, even an FA, would refer to her as "skinny."It made me think that the author desperately wants someone to call her skinny, so she made up a story where someone did.
my gf is 4 inches taller than me....ham, please. oh wait let me check maybe its because I'm thin privileged, it adds another 7" to my height

Poor guy. I place all the fat blame on his girl. Fatty friends turns others into fatties.

For the fourth time. I'm only sorry for what happened to her, not sorry for how she is right now.

This fucking bitch dude, saw her on tv once and felt the urge to punch her face non stop so I stopped watching man.
&gt; Nobody thinks of women as inferior anymore.Well, I wish that was true. As you say, it's still pretty shitty outside of the western world - but even if we forget about that there is still some shit here. I happen to be a female software developer and even though there are some awesome guys and gals in the business I still hear all this bullshit that guys are the scientific minds and so on. You know, it's not about laws nowadays, cause I can do my "manly" job and no one can fuck with that. But it's about changing the mentality, and that's in people of both genders - cause women need to realize their possibilities. I knew way too many girls in junior high/high school, who were good at math/physics but decided not to pursue a career connected to those subjects for the sole reason of thinking it's not a girly thing or something. They did consider themselves inferior. So yeah, just my two cents. Imho feminism = "i'm a girl, i can do whatever the fuck i want", not "uuuh you're discriminating my fat deformed body i'm beautiful you cis-gendered shitlord" or "you're sexually harassing me by holding the door open for me" or whatever.
Ohh, her calves look more similarly sized on this one. I think I've **finally** figured out what is going on with them. That just is a weird stance where she has one leg slightly behind the other but her calves are just so fucking huge that the blubber on the front one covers half of the back one.
Yeah, so it doesn't have to look in the mirror.
It was considered desirable in some pacific islands because only really skilled hunters could get fat and stay fat. Now those countries are dealing with the aftershocks of a culture that revered obesity. Look up pictures of Nauru. It's pretty gross.
Got to keep that pussy warm and wet somehow. Plus the FUPA is a great place to keep a couple of grilled cheese sandwiches for snack time.... Which explains the persistent under-FUPA smell.
Fair enough.
Fucking sympathizers. I hope the mods crack down on them. Fats are all inhuman until they are human, regardless of whether they're in a gym or if they're in a Burger King.
It's like those rank photos you get on cigarette boxes of what your lungs would look like if you're a smoker. Just stick em to every McFattie's burger box.
It's the "I disagree with you" that gets me every time.
The "normal people hate on fat people because they're insecure" argument annoys me so much. Fat people are the ones with that obnoxious, false confidence, f your beauty standards, type deal going on.. not us. If anybody's insecure, it's them.You could say they were being.. *hippo*crytical.

Look through the thread. He has stated that he does not want help for being a pedo, and he purposely befriends people with kids and tries to earn their trust. He said that they trust him with their kids alone. He pretty much sets up to be around people's kids and doesn't want help. Perhaps you are a pedo but don't want to out yourself
The amount of men I've had to tell to clean their smegma in the shower is disgusting. Don't their parents teach them?!

Agreed. For me, trying to eat 3500 calories on a "clean bulk" is damn near impossible.
Luckily I have a jacket to protect me, but why give them that pleasure of having two seats when you sitting there first?

I sometimes think about their influence on the horrors of factory farming, the idea of them deforming their bodies at such a horrible cost gives me a very nasty gut feeling. I can't think of it too much; it's one of the things that I really rather think not of too much.

Fat is a fact, it's never a bad word. Some people just can't handle the truth. After spending some time in SE Asia and being around hardly any fatties there, coming back home was a real disappointment.

Old navy is the worst for this. I liked to buy khaki/madras shorts from them (because they were cheap and not worth spending a lot on). I'm a 32 and have to buy a 28 if I want to be able to wear them without a belt. Interestingly enough, more expensive brands actually fit. Its as if hamplanets don't spend their money on high quality clothes.
Yup! Same here. Going to the medical center where they lumber around err'where. It's kind of just sad to watch.
That last one screams muh genetics
Puberty perhaps. My little sister grew super fast when she went through puberty so she has some stretch marks on her knees and sides. She's never been close to being overweight and has never been pregnant and likely won't be able to due to her PCKD.
This is hilarious because it's ham fatlogic that actually fuels the diet industry - "metabolism-boosting" foods, crash diets, weird supplements, spot reducing, etc. are all based upon poor understanding of basic nutrition and health science, and prey upon the "get rich quick without trying" mentality. The only ones actually subverting diet industry bullshit are shitlords that have the self control to eat and exercise like normal humans.
Nah, I don't think they give a fuck. I love Asians, never met one I don't like. But they are brutally honest. My Chinese dentist is a prime example. (to dentistry assistant) "GET ME UTENSIL" "I NEED AIR" etc To me, "You clearly smoker in past. Stop smoke or teeth fall out and you look disgusting forever" I've even heard her tell a fat patient outright he is "useless man" at brushing teeth and will "suffer greatly" if he "doesn't stop the chocolate" *lmao*
&gt; I managed not to stab anyone today.Gah. Me too, and after the shit-tay morning I had at work, that was a *major* accomplishment. I love my job, but I sometimes hate the fucking agents I have to work with. Also, congrats on not being stabby today. ;-)
Only as fast as we report them. It's a two way exchange.

Exactly. You're in fucking FPH, a sub where most women are hardcore gym goers. Society might think that girls who lift are not feminine, but we don't give a fuck. I love my girls with muscle definition. No, not body builder size. That's ugly even on men. I don't give a fuck about the length of her hair. And fuck what your definition of what is "feminine". You're the one using fat love speech now. "Curves are feminine" rings a bell? Well fuck your standards of what is feminine.
Was she about to try and drag the hot girl down with her?
I personally think that eating a piece of chocolate cake is amazing and sooo awesome and all!But eating them too much too frequently with muffins and sweets and other things just takes away its speciality. It just ruins a piece of cake if you eat it every goddamn day. Seriously, these people eat for their hurt fee-fees, not pleasure at all.

Y'know "depressant" means "central nervous system depressant," not "causes depression"?
For real. She's still less fat than many Americans.
I've seen several of these, but the rage level does not wane. Poor kid is fucked over before she hits double digits.

Why is it obese brides always have dresses that look cheap? Not sure if it's because it looks like sausage stuffing, or is actually cheap material.
How's your posture?
I wonder how tumblr would react to this fact.
Just a curious question, but do you eat sweets like chocolates, gummies, etc? A lot of fit active people I know take a few cheats now and then and I've read that your comfort food was mushrooms and cabbage (my mum makes it! it's good) so I waas wondering if that was your cheat lol
Let's not forget, not only is she blocking the dumbbells with all her bass, but whoever is taking the pic is getting in the way. People who take selfies on the gym floor are infuriating enough, folks having their fucking picture taken deserve the nuclear option.
It's so slow it's longer than the amount of time a 60+ year old female would be given in the military to complete two walk tests for a total of 2.5 miles.
I completely agree. I have issues with my lungs and back from deployment. I still walk everyday (average about 6-7 miles with my walking buddy great pyrenees Dozer). Infact my exercise helps my lungs stay clear with the help of steroids. Anyone can have a tramatic event, but a healthy life style is obtainable. If anything its like preventative maintenance, you change ur trucks oil right? Your sister should be a shining example for the hamplanets of the universe. There are tons of people ( I know quite a few veterans) who have similar issues and you dont see them asking for a hamburger, I mean handout/disability help. Gotta take charge of your own life.
Yeah, if I saw him at the store my brain would just be going "avoid avoid avoid"
That's not a crossword. That's him writing out his food order for the night so he doesn't forget to demand the extra cheese this time. Having spent all day at his super stressful call-centre job, picking up the phone to order his McBeetus treats triggers him too hard and he always forgets the extra cheese. But not today. No, today he wrote it down.
I'd be afraid to let my kids go near her
Well, there you go. The whale needs to lose weight before she should sing again.
God damn.10/10&gt;So what would trigger blacks to see "diversity" as a problem - like I did despite my own "diversity"? To blacks being racist this way makes life easier for them: to enter a better university, for their political opinion to get extra weight, to get more representation in media, to get the job someone else deserves. We are all selfish - they will not give up racism until they see it as a selfish act.I'd like to compound on this. This whole notion of being 'multicultural' through forced diversity is a farce. What happens when you subject 2 cultures to live together? They will clash until one prevails at the expense of the other. It's historically evident. The whole idea of becoming multicultural is bullshit as it always ends up eliminating cultures through idealogical friction and forced diversity laws. You see this today with the mass immigration into European nations and the population of their cities becoming majority muslim. You see it with the diversity quotas in American academia with Asians and Caucasians getting shafted for the African American or the Latino, even though they performed better. I'm not trying to throw shade at the African American or Latino communities, I'm just saying multiculturalism is one of the biggest shams the world has ever faced. I'd like to see someone try to force a country like China or Japan or Russia to become 'more diverse'.You want multiculturalism for the earth? You want diversity? Let each country be their own else it'll all just become some amorphous blob that offers none except one. And if you don't accept that one, you're a racist bigot.
Totally agree, young healthy people should be resuscitated, because it is highly likely to be successful. People for whom resuscitative efforts are extraordinarily unlikely to work should not receive futile care - that's all I'm saying.
Oh god. I'm so scared now. Someone hold me

Heads up, one of the comments on imgur was pointing out how you left your fb profile pic visible and suggested they could find your account.
Pretty sure he doesn't care. I think she is just a beard.
B-b-b-but muh cundishuns!
I bet she thought she was oh so quirky and unique and sexually funny when she did that. That's fucking disgusting and I'm sorry about what happened to you.
I just finished nursing school and I can wait to be a nurse like you
She's as big a loser as ever URL
Well yeah as you get older you don't care about looking like a super attractive, young person, but hopefully you would still care about your health. Basic exercise and a diet that isn't complete garbage shouldn't be something you outgrow.
I just showed this to my husband and posed the question, If she won the world championship blow job competition, would you let her? I think he wants a divorce now...I thought it was funny....
the fat wasn't attractive, the money was. I'm sure many in this sub would have gone for a 'fat' person(back then, so now smaller than today's fat 'average') if it mean that you didn't have to live as a slave. living in debt, serving up any positive yield you ever make, to whichever lord let you farm his land until you died when you were 35.

Yeah Monica Belluci is fucking gorgeous. I was going to say Sofia Vergara. She is probably in the dictionary next to the word Curvy. And probably like 50 other choice words. But 12/10 would kiss her on the mouth.
They're like spoilt children, insisting that the entire world change to suit them, then throwing a tantrum when it doesn't.
I think she is hot. Girl is thick like a bowl of oatmeal
I don't know what's worse, them ordering this awful shit or me just enabling it. I'm a damn whore who sells his ideals for better tips so I make the same jokes every time. In response to a generic "well I might as well go big or go home." I say "oh no! When you're here calorie counting goes out the window. haha!" I am killing these people. More food sold= better tips.
That's why you are allowed to retort with a rude fat comment. They started it. I have zero sympathy for fatfucks who want to comment on a thin or fit woman's body when using their double standards to play the victim.
My favourite episodes are the ones in which they don't lose the weight. One chick was saying that the scale was wrong the first time she was weighed. That's the only logical explanation! Definitely not overeating or anything.
Really? How interesting. What a stupid fatty. I really hope it is dead for real.
That 7th picture. Fucking hilariousIs the husband fat? I couldn't tell from these pictures

You can achieve this too, easy... it's called the liquify tool.

Why do they even bother, do they think that makeup will distract from the elephant like physique?
I think the plus-size presumes we compare her relative to runway models, as she's done some runway modeling in the past as well. In general, those chicks tend to be pretty tall (around 6 feel like Ms. Lawley), but also incredibly lean to the extent that they tend to lack much in the way of breasts and curves.Relative to most catalog or even swimsuit models, I'd tend to agree that she's pretty attractive, representative of what most hot chicks we'd see in real life may have the measurements of, and curvy or thick instead of "plus-size" in the obese sense of the word.

She is very correct. The US government's administration of the country's food supply is backwards. Nothing they do has any grounding in public health, or protection of the consumers. Rather, they are advocates for business and industry. All they are concerned with is selling you shit. They only care if the stuff degrades your health or kills you insofar as the market will have fewer customers to buy their junk.This is why commodity 'foods' are so heavily subsidized. It's all about fueling the industry of processing, packaging, transportation, markup, advertising and loads more. All middlemen. There's an entire economy built around making and selling you garbage food.The biggest threat to this huge, crooked industry is people understanding proper nutrition habits. God forbid you cut out all those middlemen and get your food from a farmer's market. This is why I roll my eyes at fatties who shun the 'diet industry'. What industry? It's microscopic compared to the junkfood industry.
Fuck off, fatass.Banned.
It can't be serious... it can't be real unless she never saw an anctual pick o Taylor
They outnumber us 2 to 1 in the US, so of course it's an us vs. them scenario. More of them so of course they're going to belch that they are right. It's an uphill battle.

Is it true 69% of Americans are overweight? For shame
He was far enough out for it to be an actual distress, if he couldn't just float back to land, I'd say easily 2-4 nautical miles.
...Who the fuck cares? I understand you guys not liking how fat is becoming more acceptable, because of health issues yada yada yada, I get it, but this is just... A woman. Who gained weight. This might be the biggest circle jerk subreddit I've ever seen
If I were a death fat id be mortified to date a thin man.
My kids wouldn't eat like that either.
It's like they need a food babysitter. I'm traveling right now and in my hostel here is a fatty. On his night stand right now is 2 empty Red Bulls, an empty bag of potato chips, an empty beef jerky container, and an empty tube of Pringles.I had Greek yogurt and smoked salmon for breakfast this morning with a glass of water.These people simply do not take care of themselves.
i've known enough fatasses who thought they were thin and hot, so of course i can verify it goes both ways.
&gt; Seriously, the program wasted like 15 minutes to "resolving" this "issue".  It's not enough that she's a selfish pig with no will power, but they gotta make sure her precious fee-fees are cared for. Fucking hams.  Hope you're feeling better, OP!
I have seen this happen. When the elevator breaks and they have to go to three flights of stairs they will whine, complain, talk about their condishuns (arthritis in the knees is a common condishun I've heard), then they will go wait in a coffee shop drinking beetus juice and eating garbage for an hour.Too bad they don't realize what it's like to watch those things. Beasts feeding on garbage because three flights if stairs is oppressing them.

When I'm cycling through the countryside on a nice sunny day I'm in total bliss just from being there and research backs up the idea. Then I get home and feel blissed out again from the endorphins. Then my muscles grow bigger and my life is better every day from then onwards. We haven't even got to the weight control yet!
She's written about the "trolls" on tumblr.[Have a look here.](URL
Predictable. Shaming men for not kissing a woman's ass even though she's completely wrong. Because it paints females as not victims.The fattest hambeast of a woman can get laid any day of the week. Channing Tatum probably can too.85% of bariatric patients are female. 60% of morbidly obese are female.
=/ I don't think that's how it works. A lot of women are feminists, fat or not. I'm a fit feminist and pretty damn outspoken about gender bias. It's important to me.Don't feminist shame, fat shame.

Have you actually said : Dad, why are you so fat? You were an inspiration to me but now you're just a slob.It is harsh but you might get somewhere.

Oh they do, a lot of the visitor flux here is in fact fatties looking for decent society members to bash on the internet in order to feel superior and forget their nearly clogged aortas. Also, what was the fat supporting sub that banned people just for commenting here again? Good thing I can't remember the name of it.

Look at the nutritional values.Screw the calories. 285 calories for a slice of pizza is not important. The problem with pizza is not the calories rather the fat in its cheese.285 calories is very roughly the equivalent of two tins of tuna. However, tuna will turn you into a motherfucker as it literally has but traces of fat and sugar and tons of protein.For the lazy fucks out there who do not want to research by themselves. Beans, eggwhites and tuna are pretty much the most nutritious food I have found. Also a variety of other fishes such as COD.Similarly, with a glass of juice, the problem is not the calories again. Its the sugar.If you eat healthy, it is nearly impossible to consume as much sugar as your brain needs. A glass of juice and you are 2/3rds there. Some more and you exceeded your levels.Then I argues with some shitlords in here about fiber and how it is impossible to find.No matter how much fiber you eat, you will never have enough. Even with coffee and supplements.Also its totally OK to exceed your fiber levels.
For point 2, I think shitlording will also be linked to misogyny/sexism.
freakish.
Sadly the stairs at my work are in the back of the building, so I never get to troll the fatties.However! This is super fun to do at stores on the normal stairs next to escalators while making eye contact with a fat on the escalator, beating them to the top.

Picture this - a Planned Parenthood advert with this still frame, and that Sarah McLachlan song, "Angel," playing.That's the only justifiable existence of this photograph, so far as I can see.
I have a theory, They spend so much time sitting that the pressure from their weight, crushes their arse to a flat pancake, then the low blood supply means less fat can get to the butt to deposit there.
I used to work at a rather popular lengerie store, and I never got hit on, though some of my coworkers were hit on/harassed. Asshats would come in and ask my coworkers to try on lingerie for them (we would never do that), tell girlfriends that we did, etc.

I think the only lifestyle benefit is having the money to pay someone to cook well-balanced meals for you. I can cook, it just takes more time out of my day than I'd like. So it's leftovers most of the time.

Eww! Tennis shoes, dress pants, lace camisole, and back fat! No redeeming qualities on this one.
Noooo. They never fit. Ever. I don't know where obeasts find sweatpants that stretch that much, I've never seen them in my size, but it looks like 10 gallons of tapioca in a 5 gallon bag :(
What happens to a fattie's brain that makes them insist on being as grotesque, disgusting and visually offensive as possible?No one wants to see this. Fine, insist that you're happy with your body but don't be a disgusting fucking cunt about. No one wants to see that shit, no one.
I mean 50 and upward. It isn't an excuse, but my 61 year old mother doesn't know the concept of counting calories, she eats instinctively the right amounts of the right foods to stay lean.
Now he just needs someone to get him a better fitting suit and he's sorted.

I bet 500$ it looks better than it tastes. It's just sugar and fat that makes your brain all high and shit. But flavour wise, it's probably a disappointment as most of these eccentric summer donuts are.
Most thin and underweight people are also not anorexic. I was moreso making the point that groups shouldn't form on unhealthy foundations. It is bad to glorify obesity or extreme dieting, psychological condition or not.
Who let that fat fuck deploy?I hope whoever his Commander was, kicked his ass out of the military.As a PT leader in the USAF, I had the pleasure of failing quite a few fatties on the yearly tests. And had even more pleasure, watching their fat asses waddle out the gate the last time with the "Less than Honorable" discharges clasped in their sausage fingers.
Those arms don't lie, bitch.

nice job deleting all your other racist comments. Look, I have read crime statistics. I understand that most violent crimes are committed by black people, but unlike you, I understand why. Most crimes are committed by people who are poor, people who aren't given the same opportunities for education and jobs as white people. This isn't just my opinion, tons of statistics will back me up. The biggest factor for crime isn't RACE, its POVERTY. Again, take your racism elsewhere.

Same here. My husband and I sat in one. I had no clue.
I bet you in a day or two she will give you the whole 'low carb diets don't work' rant
I once told a lady her eyebrows were drawn on too high.She looked surprised.
Unfortunately being overweight isn't something that CPS cares about as it's not classified as abuse. Even still, with all the bad parents out there, statistically kids are still safer not being put in the system, but that a rant for a different time/place.
I was thinking that, but there are tons of pictures on this sub of fat people just walking in the mall or eating garbage that get up voted.

I don't think it's an issue of it being poorly written, quite the opposite. He wasn't a traditional emotionless hitman, but this wasn't a traditional boring comedy about hitmen, either (like the trailer admittedly makes it appear)I think it's just a combination of a lot of things, probably didn't have a great life growing up, but more importantly, and MAJOR SPOILERS here but, he's dealing with the trauma and shock of having killed a child. You can't just write that off and pretend it's something that didn't happen in your life, like many action movies attempt to show (rarely see the hero reflecting on what he's done, nevermind being seriously bothered by it. Meanwhile, in real life, PTSD is a very serious thing for those who actually fight)

Fat people: Stop fucking up our clothes. Do you know how hard it is to find pants at 30x34? It's goddamned impossible. Somehow, if you have long legs, you have to also be a goddamned chubaroo.

Looks like she's going to be losing those legs pretty soon.
It's not unbelievable, there's plenty of fatties who do running in high school and can on a good day, run **one** mile in 8 minutes. One 8 minute mile isn't close to fast at all though, I wasn't that good in 8th grade with a 5 minute and 30 second mile.

To be fair, though, 'dieting' isn't a great thing to do. In out culture there is too much talk of dieting and not of lifestyle. I've never been even close to overweight and I've never dieted. We praise dietary inconsistencies when we should be praising a consistantly healthy lifestyle for everyone.That said, I don't think that is what they meant and that poster is kinda inappropriate.

I want to clarify something. I drew that picture. And that is the exact same picture I took when I posted it to /r/doctorwho over a year ago. I do not believe this hambeast knows where that particular gym is located. And is simply using my artwork to act like the HAES moron that she's proven herself to be. Many many of my clients at that gym have laughed at it and commented on it. I have never heard anything negative concerning my drawing. That said if anyone is wondering, the quote above was another motivator that said "I want to see you sweat so much that I could literally bathe in it if it wouldn't be so stinky." I said it after I saw one of my more planetary yet able bodied clients walking on the lowest setting on the treadmill. Her reason was because she didn't want to get sweaty. I'm a coach that lost 80 lbs on my own without any help, so I do not believe in excuses.
Snacks eaten at the gym are negative calories.
What is happening to most of the human race lately? Were we not primal hunters determined to chase down our pray and take the harsh elements like a champion? Now the modern world has left us all comfy and snug and made quite a lot of people to lazy to even go outside for a walk and enjoying fresh air. Heck now most of those lazy bastatrd gets their feelings hurt due to something they read on an add thats suposed to be motivational!This makes me sad...This is another reason why I am taking cold showers. Its to help me get out of my comfort zone a bit.
ive found a few things really cute at Chico's. Sometimes hard to find things that fit like scrubs, for instance. Im told the nursing scrubs available in shops here are all made in Asian countries and so...you cant get a top to fit your boobies unless you go up a size and then the shoulder seam is off and the arms are too big so you are like a tent pole with boobies swirling around in a ..tent. So attractive.

Yep it's true but for different reasons for pregnant women, it's not just weight gain (so it can happen to ladies who don't gain weight at all) I'm currently pregnant in my third trimester and my feet have gotten a bit bigger, I started with pretty high arches though. The body releases a hormone called relaxin to prepare the pelvis for birth and it affects ligaments allowing them to be more flexible and stretch, this in addition to extra weight during pregnancy is thought to cause your feet to lengthen because the ligaments in your arches are affected. Sometimes the change can be permanent too. URL
All I do is press 'r' and this sub comes up instead of just Reddit mwahaha.
And there goes my lunch.
I thought she was missing an arm for a moment
Why did you use the word 'however'?
This is not a problem unique to America. We're just really loud about shit.
I'm Catholic. It always tripped me out that people didn't consider me Christian. I worked at a Christian bookstore for a bit, until they found out I was Catholic. Then all I heard was "Catholics aren't Christian". Never in my life said anything against Protestants. Its weird.
I fucking love the mods here.
Fupa annexe.... I think I love you.
Still a chance the fatty might not know that.
I completely agree with you. All I do is run, but I seriously need to train my upperbody. My arms and chest are pathetically weak for my age.Edit: spelling
The cottage cheese belly on the 5th one *Pukes*
Ha! ""Your" amazingly beautiful." (Should be you're.)Fuckin cankles!
Haha the fatty telling your sister to not eat. I love it. This truly is a mans world. but like you said your sister is the one who asked for it.
Psh, men don't know how to Myspace angle
That really is the difference between us and fat people. And I know i'm not alone in that sentiment. There are plenty of people on here who have pulled themselves out of some really messed up situations to become the amazing people they are today.
&gt;Which do you think men prefer?Uh....the one that looks like it takes care of itself? Why isn't this the natural preference for everyone?
Maybe because they're iphone emojis?
I'm surprised no one has commented on "Also it's what you eat not how much." EATING TOO MUCH "HEALTHY" FOOD STILL MAKES YOU FAT AND UNHEALTHY. And it's not like she's even doing that.
that cat on her shirt looks like it is crying. probably from being stretched beyond the fabric's ability to maintain structural integrity.
you've been to new york and dont agree with everything lonelyboyonreddit says about it? fuck you
It makes me so angry because if they put half the effort toward bettering themselves, rather than trying to feed us bullshit, they might actually be a healthy weight. But no, instead, they try and take a short cut, and this isn't just a short cut to feeling better about themselves, it's a short cut to death too. Pisses me off that people waste what could have been a human body like that.
If that's what you took away from what I said then you're completely oblivious to the context and actual meaning. Congratulations
Her doctors told her that down at the Mayo-Naise Clinic.
Basically just eat less than 10,000 calories per day.
1400 pounds of target practice
Wait, you're getting hassled for not being a fat failure?
I agree that she's definitely bigger than the average model, but I would have serious trouble calling this woman fat. Maybe the model is fat, but this photoshopped picture of her does not represent a fat woman
Ah, a fellow spartankin
I absolutely love how high the posts here are getting on all.Just proves no matter what people say to avoid being singled out and doxxed by SJW's, most people think your fat, flabby worthless ass is disgusting.

Who doesn't love deadlifts?
I agree
Can I rant about c25k for a moment?Holy shit that sub is just a fatty fee-fee, selt-esteem circlejerk. I went there because I decided to start running a while back, Had to break from lifting for a while because of surgery (normal people surgery) and wanted to get back into running a bit. After like 10 minutes I nope'd right out of there. The whole thing is just armchair fatty "runners". I'll never forget, there was a post from some guy, who said he was athletic but hadn't been a 'runner' since high school. He posted his week 1 workout info, and it turns out he runs at a pretty quick pace, he's obviously in shape, he almost ran a 5k in &lt;30 minutes in his first day doing just intervals, running pace of 8.5mi/h and walking of 4. You know what the majority of the comments were? "slow down man, worry about finishing the workout first, then you can worry about the time" Motherfucker, he's already posting reasonably respectable 5k times. Just because YOU can't run 500m without literally imploding due to *lack of sugars!* doesn't mean other people should slow down their fucking pace just because it puts how shitty your accomplishments are into perspective. The worst part is that he wasn't even going off-program or boasting or anything like that, he just did the week 1 workout, but he happened to almost go 5k because he runs/walks faster than all of them. I can understand people saying "stick to the program" and I think it's best to follow a program's progression (assuming it's any good) instead of just trying to max out immediately, but it was literally just a bunch of fatties jealous about how much faster in-shape people can run than they can. There was a whole bunch of posts like that, but that stuck out the most. Never again.
Shit feels so good, yo.
Uh...Zara offers up to a [US size 14](URL
I don't think fit people are normal anymore.
Crabs in a bucket.
I don't see what my sex or that I browse reddit have to do with how attractive my face is... Or why it matters. I never claimed to be attractive, only that I have traits often associated with anorexia but that im a healthy weight.
You should have open the car door and ran for your life.
Though the context of the post was OP(fattie) saving a dog if I recall correctly so calling her fat was even for me a bit...
I guarantee you this ham isn't putting that much thought into it, nor is it actually thinking of going on a diet. The principle may be correct but this thing isn't concerned about it, it just wants an excuse to eat.
Are mashed potatos cute? Did I not get that memo?
What the fuck is wrong with you dude?
Just don't let them in at all. In fact, I'd pay extra to ensure that when I go to an amusement park there are no fat people there.
We beat natural selection, and now our weak thrive.
Even when I do 'eat for pleasure' I'm not spending the *entire day, every day* in my own filth pleasuring myself.
Oh wow, this one was blessed with brains, apparently. IT'S MUH JENETIKS!!! The struggle is real, when you can't eat 17 eclairs in one sitting... You're right. I struggle to eat more after the first one, fatass.Edit: 19, not 17.
Well, people know that it is fat logic here, so you'll get a unanimous opinion. The problem with r/fatlogic is there are a lot of actual fat people in fat logic, so ironically you'll find these excuses in the very sub that is supposed to be pointing it out. If you read medical journals, those "conditions" don't cause obesity. Metabolism does not vary that drastically from individual to individual to begin with. They are just not controlling their eating habits.People say the pill or quitting smoking "causes weight gain". Not directly. People eat more than they usually did because they are taking the pill or quitting smoking. Eating more is what is causing the weight gain. You see what I mean? Don't forget there are people who don't gain weight when taking the pill or don't gain weight when quitting smoking.
Noooooo this makes me sooo sad why take something so cute and ruin it for me :(

I don't want to date a fat person because we clearly have very different lifestyles and nothing in common. A 500 word, convoluted as hell, all over the place comment isn't going to change that. Sorry we have preferences?
I would assume more RTs would be here, considering how much obese patients tend to be a pain in our asses. Can't position them, can't image them worth a damn. They are the bane of our existence. Then you have the radiologist barking up your ass "why does this image look like shit? why would you submit this?" Because x-rays can't penetrate through 300 lbs of fat without scattering like crazy, I can't change physics.
Umm sexplore*
Heirloom, I dont think they are, they don't even match. Pawn store most likely. Hes the only one that works because of "health conditions"
Looks like soft ice cream.
It's not that the diet doesn't work, it's that they stop at goal weight and go back to McDonald's.
The owner says he wouldn't be able to support us migrating there, even 5000 new users would be too much. But yeah the lack of mod tools is a big problem as well.
West coast of Canada, some fat people but near zero morbidly obese.
Where do you work!? That sounds incredible!
Ohhh. Ok!
29 is Pearchan. She's fat in the before picture, you just can't tell because it's only her head.
Already had that problem lol. The worst. :'(
There are so many other places to look at attractive people. If we start congratulating each other on being human sized, we are letting the fatties win by making it something special and worth celebrating, rather than what we should expect as basic human decency and self worth.
Oh yeah they look super happy! They're definitely smiling, but you can't tell because their cheeks are weighing down their lips.It seems the UK (and the world) would save so much money if it could just create a massive, government-run treadmill farm where people over a certain BMI are forced to run every single day until they've lost enough weight to work. Think of the profits that could be made if you hooked the treadmills up to power generators. Motivating the hammies would be cheap, too. Just hang a Big Mac from a stick and watch them try to catch it.
Yea, I've been bullied my whole life. Your scum sucking ass hasn't said anything new to me. Beside that I don't dress flashy, I'm not delusional about my weight or health. I'm improving my health because my husband motivated me, because he's fit, and we want a baby.

Yup, he lost it all again.
Guys its infamous. Look up "skinny arm pose"
Always hate on fatties, only stop hating fatties when they are no longer fatties.
If this was gandalf we'd all be suckin' orc dick right now.
the front parts of their brain dies off. the part of the brain that also just so happens to have the personality.explains a lot, eh?
Yeah, I've had multiple nights when I don't have the kids with me where dinner was a black coffee while I mean to start some food, but then get distracted and go to sleep instead.

He skipped ass day
Hehe
Lol she may eat less then her supposed gf, but i bet she eats a lot more processed food and sugary foods. That shit will fill you up like a balloon. Fucking idiot fatty
Why does the fat picture not have diet coke? And why does the second picture not have plain water?

She is single handedly increasing the amount of gay men in the country, it's a brilliant gambit!
And the best part is she ordered the suit in an XL!

The second video would be from Opie and Anthony. I'm sure a quick youtube search for it would present the results you're looking for.
True. I guess I shouldn't be applying any kind of sense here.
That bionic leg is bad ass. I'd hit it.
Soooooo...is it bad that I knew her? I went to high school with her and she would always have these huge black dudes giving her money and taking her places and she met them online. She was pretty annoying. I remember once she wanted to try out for the dance team I was on and she asked for my help in making a routine,I showed her a routine I thought would be pretty easy and as soon as I did a high kick she laughed and said why would I think she can do that. DANCERS KICK AND SPIN DON'T TRY OUT IF YOU CAN'T DO IT! She also got her tongue pierced in the parking lot after school.
Hey, "curves" don't make themselves.
Still wouldn't work. But if you said there was a free buffet at the finish line, they could do a marathon.
Aaah Achtung, you're the best. I always get motivated to get of my ass and to the gym when I see your posts.The one I particulary liked was the "Almost an hour for 3,26 miles" In the same time I run over double this distance :'D Also, the vein popping is cute. Like, my veins on my forearms and legs are ridiculous, even when it just gets warmer around me. And she's actually proud of that...
What I don't understand is that /r/fatepeoplehate is one of the most open, accepting subs on the whole of reddit. How can we be compared with the racist subs? It is pathetic that fat people's fee fees are so hurt and almost everyone seems to support them outside of this reddit. We hate people who destroy themselves, not people who are black, Asian or whatever. Fat people are entitled, pathetic losers that cannot stand the freedom of speech for people to say they are disgusting. FAT LURKERS HERE - FUCK YOUR FEE FEES AND GET LOST.
It looks like her chin is a huge insect bite.
You'd need something the size of the Hope Diamond to not look tiny when you're that much of a chubster.
Former fatty here, yes. Made me start working out and wanting to take care of myself more.
what is HAES? Been seeing it everywhere here but can't figure out what it means nvm googled it. good lord
You guys are fucking retarded.Guess what? She hates fat people too. That's why she's clearly losing weight.Fucking idiots in this sub,I swear
There was a gym billboard in San Francisco a few years ago that really angered the fatties."When the aliens attack, they will eat the fat ones first."
We are.. We are Marshall..
Wait till the day you realize you can't buy ANY sizes at certain stores because of their fucking vanity sizing.
Keep seeing these photos....they have a "your own cup" thing for real? Man. Even when i did get slushees i never wanted more than a 20oz. Kids only ever get the smallest.

Does that sub still exist?
Fuck, do I ever hate looking at atrophied legs. And yet I'm back here, again. Reminding myself to do calf raises as often as possible.
Cocaine is a vegetable.Yeah, no support for that idea, but being a high fructose corn syrup fueled freak is perfectly fine.

They are already quite good at making their teeth fall out.
They're shills for corporate processed food companies and low-income-marketed fast food companies. They're the propaganda wing of the processed food industry. :3They talk about "eat good food" but they don't know what the hell "good food" even is. There's a huge difference between a discerning gourmet and a walking food disposal.
That gif gave me a brain aneurysm.

This is not surprising at all. Those must be new redditors. They would be way fatter if they were experienced redditors.
&gt; I can't even understand where she would get that from?She probably was always looking for a good reason for her weight other than her own inactions and she decided to blame it on that.
How does one think that it's okay to wear a shiny elastic top when one has a waist the same circumference as one's chest? I wish fat people would stop wearing this nonsensical "quirky" outfits and dress for their size instead. Like a fucking rice sack. Stop showing me your rolls.
He's upgraded his fat cart significantly.
Damn straight!They're a bit like bacteria too, in that the more fatties there are, the more acceptable it is.
*His name is Robert Paulson*That's where she got it from -only meatloaf is delicious.
Maybe she's making shit up so she's going to get a mob to swarm them as the police won't do shit on a fake assault accusation.
Some of that looked pretty fucking good. But that's like 3 days worth of food.
Wow. Basically they're just making a safe haven for people who don't want to face their beliefs with logic, with the same kinds of distractions as you give toddlers.
Only you can prevent ham confidence. Benned for fat sympathy.
'Bondage' also makes sense to an extent.
Man they got it ingrained in my head. I still have to check bmi charts and stuff to reassure myself. I'm not even on the light end of the charts or whatever the Internet tells me for 6 foot tall.
You weigh everything john slow
That actually made me so irritated. Good job!!! I'm letting the hate flow through me.

With legs so big they block out the sun, with smells so strong they make the dead hum. I would not touch them on the bun, and only end them with a gun.
I was thinking the same thing. As a calorie counter, even if you were to do 5 hours straight of intensive exercise per day it would be difficult (Although not impossible) to burn 12,000 calories a day.I'm not saying that he didn't do days like that occasionally, but to do it 5 times a week seems...well...unlikely.It's kind of a difficult thing to judge. There's really no standard when it comes to Olympians. I can tell you "A normal person burns..." but Phelps isn't normal, and is probably at the high end even for athletes. Still, it's possible.
I really think exactly correct is the best kind of correct.

oh shit. but according to them I look like a prepubescent/anorexic kid too, so that makes it okay, right? right? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Lingerie companies should be arrested for even making lingerie in those sizes.
That reminds me of a joke (I can't remember what comedian said it), "Obesity is the only thing that if we had a walk for the cure, would actually cure it."
Ham argument: "We evolved to store fat!" My reply: "Yeah, and run long distances, and endure periods without eating."
There's zero chance she fits in that wheelchair.

I think the one on the left is widely known to be annorexic, not sure though. Do not quote me on that.but she really does look underweight. The torso/neck area, the arms, *the ass* or the lack thereof, back, etc.
I was bullied by fatfucks. This kid will be just fine. He will learn to hate fat people early. Man! Fatness makes you mean.

You're right. I guess I just see it like people differentiating between "anorexic-looking" and "anorexia nervosa". But I am definitely aware of my bias having been raised by narcissists.

Something I'm also not a fan of, is the aggression and people talking about injuring or killing fattys. Obviously there's a light hearted jokey tone. But that shit doesn't belong here. One thing hating on chunky monkeys, but take it to the point of violence is ridiculous.
My gym costs around $100 a month.. so.. maybe I need to start a fund for myself! I'll wear sponsor stickers and everything. "Sponsored by Luey_Lou"Sounds good huh?*elbow nudge*
I hate people who are like 230 of mostly fat and brag about their 2 plate bench. Congrats fatty, I hope the bodyweight bench was worth the heart diesese.Probably wasn't related. I just needed to vent about my stalled lifts.
What bothers me the most is that they give their bad habits to their kids. They can't do any activities with them, and they're probably too lazy. If your kids have your shitty nutrition from the beginning, if they don't get to play, if they don't get to move, then you're a shitty parent.
It's fucking hilarious though that he's probably clenching his ass cheeks and intensifying the waddle to hold that massive umbrella there

I have NO clue. As a tall dude, all my life, Ive been a BMI 18-19.7 range. That's pretty boney. Ive also been very active too and I have never gotten bruises by simply walking down street. That bitch is so far gone, she has no idea what being thin is like and just makes up life occurrences in her head.
Thin privileged is actually being able to tell when someone is pregnant and not just a fat as hell.
You have good chances to reach it before her, though, even if you have to go a long way round.

No, she just took both their pants off and sat around waiting for someone to walk in and assume they were having sex. At least that's how it happened the way she told the story. Who knows if she's telling the whole story though..Edit: I see now that she has posted that she *did* actually have sex with him. Burn the rapist bitch

Because the kid would eat nothing but butter if he could. I make him eat peanut butter because at least it has protein. He gets two pieces of toast, one with peanut butter and one with butter. Granted, they don't need much protein at that age, but it's the one protein source that I don't have to fight him every step of the way to get him to eat.
I think you just witnessed patient zero, bro.

This is why you never give out information about your real life online, especially on dating sites. Nothing. Don't xpost pictures that you have on your Facebook and IG, especially if they're tagged. Don't put your work details on social media. If you're from a small town, change your location to a bigger metropolitan area (Seattle, Chicago, etc.) - technically you're still local, but much harder to track you down. But mostly people get burned on pictures. _Don't share pictures in public that can be reversed image searched back to your Facebook or IG_. When you think of it, the guy could've been the nicest, most polite, most fat-accepting fellow there is, and reject her for other reasons (e.g. - already seeing someone, forgot to change account, etc.) but you never know how entitled, nasty and petty some people will turn out to be, she could just as well forge their entire exchange and get him in trouble just the same.
If ISIS put a gun to my head and said "fuck that fatty over there," i'd say, "fuck you, shoot me". there are things worse than death, and fucking a fatty is one of them
Huh, I guess they were pretty much ready to pull the trigger then.
I'm so happy this became a reality.
There is one person thanking you for it. Nothing about this picture is NSFW or NSFL. You obviously wouldn't get banned for not tagging it.
He has a beer gut for sure, but most men &gt; 45 usually has one. Not saying it's a good thing tho.

So the first sentence...I am a male that is 10 inches TALLER and 20 pounds LIGHTER than she is. And that is a 'small fat' that's just some serious bs created by tumblr fags

I have the biggest soft spot (;p) for McDonald's chicken nuggets and fries. I eat it maybe one every 6 months, but *dear god* do I love me some nuggets and fries. I would eat this every single fucking meal.
There's a subreddit dedicated to eating less than 1200 calories a day.
Omgerd Hobbit Hugs for everyone. I'm actually really touched to see so many other people coming forward with similar issues.
If you look to the left of the fries you can see the stained floor tiles.It looks like stool stains.So this monster is eating food on the floor less than 1 foot from fecal/urine stains.It also looks like a worm crawling around. I know it's a piece of thread but now my mind is playing tricks on me thinking that's a worm.
For me it was because i was embarrassed for anyone to notice how out of breath i was doing simple things, so it became something i started doing subconsciously. As soon as i picked up on it i tried to stop. Never really did till now...130 lbs lighter. :S
ewwwww! did she eat her eyes?
You're the kind of cynical, inconsiderate, malicious bitch I would marry.

yes i suppose this could work if my hands were free. kind of want to know what its like to be tased. thats just me being a weird bitch. i'll pass on the pepper spray though, sounds nasty. ive considered alternatives to carrying because honestly, i really dont want to have to make a decision to shoot someone because i really don't want to kill anyone. i've thought about one of those little billy club whacker things but that would require me to carry a purse or a bag which I usually don't use.
Roasted Brussels Sprouts can actually taste amazing. Cut em in half, drizzle lightly in olive oil, maybe add some soy sauce and spices, and bake for like 15 minutes at 400 degrees until they are crispy on the outside.
The pronunciation is welt = velt (sounds like belt)schwerz = shchmerts
Dafuq?! That's almost as bad as when I overheard two obese former coworkers of mine. One was saying to the other that there were no links between obesity and diabetes. Why not? Because her brother, who is even more obese than she is, *doesn't* have diabetes while she *does*. She said that diabetes runs in the family. Making getting and having diabetes *only* a hereditary thing, and that her brother and family members who are non diabetic were just lucky they didn't inherit it. Nah, bitch. It's more that they have *yet* to develop diabetes.
No one gets to be so fat they're immobile without an enabler.
I didn't make it very far. I'm just as disgusted with the author! Although, there is no thin without fit over the long term and I hope she blows up into a butterball so she can frolick up and down the aisles with her obese friends. By frolick I mean make grunting noises while riding a fat-mobile to an early grave. Hopefully this all happens quick to save the tax payer money.
Cheese ain't health food. The bread is slathered in high cal oil. Tomatoes are from a can with added sugar. ???
First of all, welcome. unless you're fat. Second, I posted some pics from a makeup sub here. They're very PC about feelings over there and got rather upset about how mean I am. Now they follow me and Downvote me all the time. Fin

Kind of has a point. These gat fucks aren't going to change their lifestyle.
I'm vegan so I mostly eat fruits/veggies which are extremely low calorie. Its really hard to go over if all you eat is really really low in calories.
Eating is binary to some people. Either you eat everything, or you eat nothing.
This guy is an army reserve.
Gold.
seriously....such sheltered and lucky lives they have and don't even realize it.
Yeah, try non chair mom and pop types or order off the kids menu. I usually just order a few sides vs the whole meal. Like an english muffin, cottage cheese, and bacon.
the fat clogs their nasal passages, that's why they breathe with their mouths hanging open all the time and snore while awake. fucking horrifying.
Holy shit. Her legs look like dugongs.

I want to get into lifting for myself mostly to rebuild a lot of muscle mass I've lost in recent times due to illness, and a bit for my hubby cause I wanna rock dat ass for him.He is currently getting into lifting again mostly for himself and his health, but a bit for me as well cause he wants to look good as well as feel good.And for both of us no small amount of wanting to show up fattie tubbers.

I stopped drying them, but it was too late. I really need some more jeans so maybe I'll try to find some with a long leg! Good luck with them. They are amazing jeans.
Well I hate fat people so I subscribed. But I just realized these people don't just hate fat people, but they actively wish all of them dead. They don't want to shame them into becoming better people. They just want them to die. While I'm probably somewhere on the autism spectrum, these people are straight up psychopathic. I still have the ability to empathize with people. The subscribers to this subreddit apparently don't based on their voting and moderation.
I didn't know this was a thing. How do I get in?
Same here. Potatoes taste great and helps keep me satisfied. They don't have a lot of nutritional value but I prefer them to rice. Cup can't be more than 200cal anyway.

Okay, good, I was worried. I don't want to be pegged as a fatty sympathizer, I'm too much of a shitlord for that!
Just keep grinding it out along with keeping the muscles fed. I'm sure you know the importance of protein but I can't emphasize it enough
Most staples I have seen have a small (1/4 of an aisle) food section, the rest of the aisle would be filled with typical office supplies.
No sympathy but I hate fat people as well as I hate skinny faggots. Let's see a picture of your body mod if you above and beyond what a person should look like. I'll show a pic of mine if you're too big of a bitch
Fuck off back to a HAES subreddit you responsibility-externalising piece of butter-huffing shit.
I understand this sub and what goes on here but this perplexes me. I've been a personal trainer at the YMCA for awhile now and honestly, those that are obese tend to be the typical lazy individual in the gym.I am not against this sub and I do understand what that door is used for in a gym, however, I try to understand that while obese people can be very hard to motivate and understand, it is my duty to educate them on how to diet and excercise a proper way so they can bust their ass without getting discouraged in the weight room. Continuing to hate obese or "fatties" entering the gym sort of seems counter productive to what this sub stands for.With all of this being said, I have been responsible for 6 clients in the past 2 years who have all lost 60+ lbs and I do this on the side as a college student. It is amazing to see that while it isn't enough to impact the world, I have changed 6 individuals lives and have made them better simply by listening to their problems and showing some compassion. Everyone has to start somewhere and some are just lazy, others were just unfortunate that their parents didn't care to educate them on the effects of not dieting or excercising, which is very important at a young age. TL;DR show obese individuals more patience, in order to fix the problem we cannot become part of the problem in a gym atmosphere.
"Fat is beautiful and I am curvy! Men need to accept me and love me!Except fat men, they are disgusting and ugly."
I think it would give them a good reason to keep their dresses too small for these beasts.

Why is it these people who say "love your body" have body parts that look like they're trying to escape?

25-40. It depends on baby size. With a big baby about 20 pounds goes away right in the delivery with water and everything. My understanding is the remaining weight is there to help breastfeeding. A woman who gains 40 pounds or less during pregnancy and breastfeeds can easily be LOWER than pre-pregnancy weight once she's done.
Any normal person is more attractive than a fat person of the same height xD That said, short petite girls are awesome! Fuck the haters, yo

He used to be a fatty, he draws himself that way because in his mind's eye he still sees himself as a subhuman piece of horse shit.
Hahaha, my good lord, 2nd left looks like she's teeheeing.

Meh I do this in real life. Anyone who tries to call me shallow or creepy gets a heavy dose of shut the fuck up. In fact, one of my favorite activities these days is talking to the svelte in front of the goo goblins. Ignoring the fat person for the skinny person just makes my fucking day.
From the Bama and can confirm......chances of fat today are gonna be in the upper 70s today. With a chance of being covered in grease being in the lower 40s.
Always with the flip flops. It's like they're trying to show off how disgusting they are.
Agreed. As soon as I saw that picture, I thought about how I would honestly want to kill myself if I ever had my chin nestled in a double chin when I smiled or looked down.
The McDonalds in California don't have the odd cupholder shape anymore as far as i have seen. The Large cup is what used to be medium atleast here.
Yes we do. You've just been lucky enough not to run across any.

You need some sense raped into you
There is having PCOS, and then being so fat that you can't have a normal period. I don't think most hambeasts know the difference.
.... that post did not go where I expected it to.... 2 bras is not the end of the world. 4 boobs on the other hand is freaky.
hahahahaha best joke i have read all day. these tumblrina's delusions are running deeper.
Upvoting for that special mini-vomit in the back of the throat. Well played, OP.
What a huge deal to make over something a normal person could accomplish without even thinking about.

&gt; If someone posted a thread with the term in the title, wouldn't it get removed?No. At least I wouldn't remove that. If another mod did, I would reapprove it and tell them not to.&gt;Im pretty sure I can find instances of bans for using racist terms - maybe not banned by you, but bans nonetheless. Probably. The other mods have banned for it before, and I've usually unbanned.&gt;If those people using the terms were not banned, they were almost certainly down voted to oblivion.Which is fine. The votes can decide on that one, but I'm not gonna be some kind of word police.Think for a second, what exactly do you think is the purpose of that flair?
The worst bit is that the rest of the world lets them. If soicety wasn't so accomodating agreeing with the bullshit that there's nothing they can do about it etc, and going around pretending it's ok then they'd be more motivated to do something about it. All the sympathises just make it worse.
Lynch mobs aren't really commonplace outside of Guatemala anymore, so there really is no existing way to punish them at present.

Oh you know that she knows she's fat. She's accepted that truth. The truth that she *hasnt* accepted is that it's not okay.

Thanks for getting if off the ground lads.
&gt; He doesn't deserve a good woman like me, his loss.Wow, what a deluded Christmas ham she is.
You actually like people and want to have a good relationship rather than leech on to whatever person you get first for years until you become a "healthy" blob. You also want him to be attracted and enjoy your presence rather than look at you like the hambeast with no discipline or hope of actual reliability he's stuck with. How dare you?!
Maybe she just got back from the vet?
So was my family. If there's anything that rustles the jimmies of the legitimately hard-working poor, it's lazy parasites mooching off the gov't.Just have to be smart about how you frame your comments.Frame things in terms of how fatlogic behavior harms (and it is, so you'd be telling the truth) other legitimately needy families who have fallen on tough times, and the welfare system as a whole.I think you'll be able to find plenty of material from the British news, given how many articles I've come across discussing fat pieces of shit getting weight-loss surgery and/or fat rehab on the public's dime, and how they still don't lose weight because they continue to stuff themselves and don't give a shit that they're wasting taxpayer dollars.
Mmm *mm* ***mm***. The muscular guy. Not her.

We need a fat person rehab facility. Edit: *sub-human rehab facility.
"smallfat" is the same as "bigthin" as far as I'm concerned, both are doublespeak as far as I'm concerned.If you're telling us "fat but working on it", all that means to me is you walk on a treadmill and "treat" yourself to a whole pie when you make a mile.

Starting from slouching, the blob clumsily puts its hands on the ground. With much grunting, it manages to shuffle its feet sadly into position. There is another grunt of make-belief effort but no pushup is to be had. Finally, it gets its feet infront of itself again and pushes on its knee, no squat occurs. Not a single burpee was performed correctly that day.
I read the other day somewhere that up to 20% of calories can be burnt by mental exertion. So maybe fat people genuinely think less? It would explain a lot.
I follow two simple rules, eat only when I'm hungry, if there are options, choose the healthiest one. For me that means no breakfast (I actually feel really sick if eat before 1130 or so, not sure why), moderate lunch and healthy snacking till a light dinner. I don't exercise as much as I should, but I'm 5'4 115, and I maintain that by daily walks and eating about 1700 calories a day. It's all my body needs when I'm not pregnant. Once every eight months or so I'll download a calorie tracking app and count calories for a week to make sure I'm close to where I should be...eh it's not rocket science to stay thin lol
You need to unfriend this person. Now.

On the plus (sized) side that's one less fatty that's reproducing. Shitlord doctor wants you to pass on your genetic superiority.
Beached on the right.
Yeah, some people aren't familiar with the American vs German lines. American lines shouldn't really go above 80-85, but some of the German lines can be pretty big, some even getting up to 130, and being fairly healthy.
Yes! But only if you are willing to live with hiking, video games, and a mild obsession with brewing mead.

That last video made my heart hurt. Poor pony. :(
Probably implied, but I think it deserves to be said that it applies to men as well. I had a roommate whose dating criteria for guys boiled down to not fat or "chubby", under 30, and not too terribly shorter than her. That's it, outside of them kicking a puppy at some point she'd give pretty much anyone a chance. It's absurd how seldom even that minimum was met.
CHOO CHOOO! Next stop, Diabeetus!!
Sounds like she fucked him without his consent. That is rape.
What kills me about this is the statement "I'm glad they're finally realizing there's other body types". I see it all the time. Its not like people are totally unaware of other body types, its a magazine celebrating beauty. That's it. That's why they put beautiful models in it. That's what people want to see. Jesus fucking Christ my jimmies are a-rustled.
This guy has a pretty fucked up idea of what a woman is.

Girl here. I just looked at one of your posts. You're lovely. Part of that other woman's PMing could have been okay if she ONLY said she was concerned about you and your health. But mentioning mens' preferences gave the lie to what she was saying. She's just a bitter woman.
Yes! I loved how bad ass all of the women were, even the wives were bad ass. But they are gonna be mad about how not one was a little over weight.

What a coincidence. My blood work also came back perfectly healthy for a 21 year old last time i had it checked.The thing is...i am much older than 21.Will she still be healthy at my age? Hell, will she be ALIVE at my age?

Hating yourself can lead to you harming it, which can include not giving a shit anymore and letting your body go to hell. I became disabled in the Marines. Shit is not fun. There is no sob story allowed, people either tell me I deserve it for enlisting or that I need to pray to Jesus, some start ranting about the military while others get overly sensitive. There is no need for a sob story anyway. It happened. Being upset doesn't fix it. *Fixing it* fixes it. Let them placate themselves into an early grave. Living well is the best revenge. If you want to bitch about it, find a support group or you can even shoot me a personal message. Don't beat yourself up over this.

Indeed. It's a great way to supplement the people who you wouldn't normally run into during a busy day in school or at work. One girl I met off OkC seriously lived across the friggin' street from me for an entire year, yet we never met. Turns out she is a Shitlady who hates fatties, and we probably would not have met absent the medium of online dating.
Probably they would have been whining about how the Church was fatshaming them and hurting their fee fees for calling them gluttonous sinners.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. My eyes still work.
I just want to be clear about how nobody,regardless of gender, can be attractive if they are fat.

Ok, this one I can understand. They're both in the same "weight class" so to speak.
What the fuck is going on with her forehead? Did she eat her hairline too?
Lies, they hover around like the pests they are to get butthurt and justify their 'activism'.
Ahaha yeah I see what you mean lol. Now I'm going to be thinking of fatties everytime I play her :P
She might not be a goth. She might just be visibly rotting.
Health at every size bullshit
She wants to be that weight. If you've ever seen her videos it's quite clear that it didn't happen by accident. She even pokes fun at how fat she is. I don't think it's a shame I just think she's an idiot.
It's been triggered by shitlords on Twitter.
That's a whole lot of face.
58,513.4 grams here! Y'all need to go on a diet!
Lol right? That's nothing
If this isn't an example of why the human race deserves extinction, I don't know what is.
The girl on the right must be an anomaly then. It's in the genes!
I always found the burritos harder to finish. Before I switched to just ordering bowls, I would get through at most, a little more than a half of one. Might have something to do with how quickly the burrito falls apart, though.
The first picture literally looks like a man in drag.
Lol what anime is this?Rarely watch anime, but the shitlordry... Gotta give it a chance.
Mkayyy.(Your alright, I just thought you died or something)
I thought fatties just shit themselves anyway resulting in them smelling like shit 24/7, I may be wrong.
Like stuffing their faces with crap when they're still small kids
I dunno... the french are assholes
She looks like whatever question she is about to ask, will piss me off.
[Man the harpoons!](URL
Leggings aren't pants regardless of how thin or fat you are. Yoga pants shouldn't be sold above a size M.
Same thing I do every night pinky. Hit the gym hard.
Dear god, she looks twice her age.
True, and it plays into what the processed food industry is doing with food, which is to take out the natural fats and protein in whole foods and replace that shit with sugar and processed trash, and sell it as "reduced fat" like it's better for you. Like it's a good thing to add in more calories from added HFCS and remove the healthy fats naturally present in that food. Ugh.
And then it will be posted on fatpeoplehate and it will scar our brains
What a failure of a parent. Poor child is already so addicted to cola he's stepping over common courtesies to feed his greed.
I know exactly what you mean I actually have lost count of how many times my genetics and luck have helped me to get in shape. Like of course training 6 days a week and eating healthy play a small part but it's mostly genetics and luck I have to thank.
The anchor lol. Or she did jump, or said something like " I can't jump it these tight jeans" and laugh it off until she can eat away the feelings later. Instead of doing something about it. Exercise makes you feel better than eating it's a scientific fact.
I'm just getting to this thread, what the fuck happened? Can someone cap it for me?
extra curdled!
Never. But I get the feeling that only the superfit are considered "not ham" here, and everyone without a gym membership is only a fattie in waiting. Which is not the case.
I could not agree more! A girlfriend of my lives with one of these makeup obsessed hams. It's not by choice, the fatty is a niece of the private landlord and at first only needed a place to stay for a month whilst she was looking for work (so far it's been 3 months) one Friday night we agree to let the ham come out for a few drinks with us. Before we started getting ready my friend and I agreed to go for a jog. Ham laughs and says she'll be ready by the time we're back. We run for an hour and when we get home surprise surprise it takes another TWO HOURS until the ham is ready. Three fucking hours spent on doing makeup and hair. I'm a lady, I wear makeup (given I don't wear eye stuff and I get it, applying eyeliner is an art form that takes time to perfect) but you could have done an hour of exercise, spent another hour planning, preparing and eating a decent meal instead of snacking on junk whilst parked in front of your mirror and a third hour getting ready. Fuck.
Only a fucking moron would really believe that.
Hey!Good on you for losing the fat and getting your health back! On to the bad news, unless your diet was rich in protein and you lifted a lot during your cut, around 20 of those 50 lost pounds are muscle, not fat. When you restrict your calories but don't lift you lose fat AND muscle.Go read the wiki at /r/bodybuilding and /r/Fitness . **After which**, if you want help, shoot me a PM and I'll explain how to get to your goals. I've been where you are and achieved my goal.ELI5: To "tone" (aka build muscle) you need a surplus of calories, but to lose weight you need a deficit. Losing more than 0.7% of your weight per week **or** eating less than 0.75 grams of protein per pounds of body weight while on a weight loss will sacrifice muscle mass along with adipose tissue. Losing fat and gaining muscle at the same time is almost impossible, you either have to be on steroids or really really new to lifting and still a bit overweight.Go read the wikis and pm me if you need more help! Congrats!
I'm going to start calling them circumferentially-long people.
I've always told myself I'd never let myself get fat, then I came to this sub. And I suddenly started realising I was at the gym every waking hour

This needs to be the next PS battle.
Or they have no excuse to go anywhere. Shit, when my wife and I first got married, we went everywhere. Hiked a lot. It would have been devastating to get up and have the Mrs not want to go anywhere and just eat instead.
Animated characters usually have exaggerated features. Most commonly the head, mouth, and eyes for the purpose of more noticeable expressions. Of course there are going to be people with impossibly small waist lines. There are also characters with impossibly big muscles. Yet you never hear anyone whining about boys feeling pressured to have big muscles, even though that does happen. Apparently only little girls seeing impossibly small waists in cartoons where animals speak, sing, dance, and make pop culture references get body image problems.Now that I think about it, the only body type that I haven't seen exaggerated in animation is fat people. Characters like Ursula from The Little Mermaid were exaggerated portrayals of fat people at the time, but now it's not uncommon to see people fatter than her ~~walking~~ in a scooter rolling down the street. Then there's the bed ridden fat people who, as far as I know, is unheard of in animation.
Utters.
Fun fact: In China, they do the same thing but with the fourth floor. The reason is because the word for "die" is the same as "four".
I was blessed with an OG Asian shitlord for a mom. She's got no qualms about telling anybody in our family that they are "getting fat." Unfortunately, her teachings did not get through to my sister who is fat as fuck and doesn't give a shit. Sigh. She's one of *those*.
It's pretty much the definition of cringe-worthy. I'd agree that it used to be fun. But that was a long time ago. When it started, the general tone was "hah, these people take the internet way too seriously! That's funny!" It's since turned into a giant group of people that take the internet way too seriously.
Holy shit! I wish I had thought of that! I just ate a pretzel dog a little bit ago with fatties looking on in disgust because I only (*only* ha!) ate one. I am way too skinny and *obviously* need to eat more.It would have been more fun and less awkward for me doing it your way!
Ummm ok
I'm a healthy individual, too. But I wear a size 8. I've worn a size 8 since I hit puberty at age 10. Usually the people I see trying to sit into size 2 are very petite women (no hate there) or teenage girls. Your rant sounds like, to me, that the size 6-12 women are part of the problem. We're really not that uncommon, and we certainly don't qualify as landwhales./rant
How do we know they're fat? Because only a fatty would get so butt hurt as to brigade another sub because we hurt their fee-fees. Sadly, online marching does not have the same effect as actual marching.They come here to comment because they hate we hold a mirror to their sloppy habits and rationalizations.On edit: I'm fueled on chicken breasts, kale, and butthurt fatty downvotes.
Why do they take these angles if they are so proud of their lard? I guess it is just more fatlogic.
usually its a power thing... The thinner person knows they are the best thing that could ever happen for hammy. Usually the power player ends up treating the ham like crap and cheat on them. And they get off on knowing the hammy still wont leave them because of their low self esteem. I only base this off of knowing 2 guys that were bodybuilders that would date fat chicks and treat them like crap. Oh and the hams will always say yes to what ever weird sexual thing they wanted to do, like blowjobs while they take a crap o.o
This article is a piece of steaming cow shit that pretends to be neutral and journalistic but in reality, is smeared with a gross thumb towards the crusty HAES brigade's propaganda. As other comments here mention, where are the photos of 'lardwhales' and 'hambeasts' to put everything in perspective, where are the statistics and numbers from the healthcare system that proves without a trace of doubt that the Psychofats are burying our hospitals in fat? Most importantly, and as the single comment on the article rightly mentions, where the fuck are scientific, peer reviewed papers, published in well respected journals that crystal-fucking-clearly and spelled out in giant, bold, sparkly letters scream that BEING OVERWEIGHT IS FUCKING KILLING YOU. I hate this kind of pretend-journalism.EDIT: I just read the article again, slightly more level-headedly and I realise I might have discredited a little to harshly. Anyways, I still believe the article is missing the cornerstones of the 'fathate' position.
Diabetics are really, really prone to dehydration (the word 'diabetes' is basically Greek for 'pissing a lot'). With type 1 and type 2, the body is literally trying to piss out all the sugar in the blood. With other forms of diabetes (i.e., insipidus), the diabetes refers to the symptom of excessive urination, not to anything to do with insulin or blood sugar.
You'd really look down on a 5'0 woman who wanted to defend herself from multiple huge men with something other than her fists?

The poor fucker that pulled that corset tight is still in traction. That's a lot of potential energy stored there. If she sneezed and busted a grommet, it would be like a fat grenade going off. Kids injured, dogs missing, cars turned over. Not pretty.

You know how Tumblrinas bitch about cultural appropriation? Well stop appropriating my fucking illness for an excuse why you're fat and can't lose weight!
Too late from the looks of it.
former fatty here, i'm 6'2 and at my max I weighed 280 pounds, i played football for 5 years and when all that was done i slowly weened myself off of junk food, soda and being a lazy ass. I'm down to about 190 and I'm not at my ideal weight but I know how fat I used to be when I see the jeans I used to wear (size 42 vs a size 32 now). I hate baseball cards.
hell yeah! Berea!

If you're going to post about spelling errors then you should at least use "revel" correctly.
An argument could be made that there is something fundamentally wrong with you that, despite the forum we're speaking in, has nothing to do with weight.
One might mistake me for a glutton, too, if they saw how much I ate. My physical training requires that I eat way more than I'd like so I can build strength, so I can perform better gymnastically. I have to eat ridiculous amounts to get my protein and energy requirements, and it's usually still not enough. I drink my delicious whey shakes to supplement. I'd rather not eat so much, because it gets to be expensive.You aren't what you eat. You are *what you do* with what you eat. I'm not a body builder, I don't give a damn about aesthetics; I am an just athlete who wants to be competitive. Being a sexy beast is just a bonus.
You're just as bad as the disgusting fat fucks you mock. You over-indulge for your short-term enjoyment while turning yourself into a sloppy, pitiable mess. Get your shit together. And I'm coming from a place of experience - I am an alcoholic. Or was one. Drank my ass off for 10 years. Realized what a complete piece of shit I was and quit, been sober for almost 3 years and will never touch the shit again. Hard but worth it. Much like losing weight is, I'm guessing (never been fat. Even at my most disgusting drunken worst, I've always been thin, thank fucking god)tl;dr being an unapologetic drunk is just as bad as being a gluttonous butter huffer. OP you suck

we don't have american sizes in EU. i hoped people would get what the hell i meant but apparently not.
&gt;The thing is, we've got rules that apply to that. "No dissent" and "keep the peace" both apply here. Yelling at op for being an undisciplined alcohol addict isn't keeping the peace, and arguing with the mods when they say cut it out is dissent. So really, we just have strict rules.Sure but would the same people not be banned if they worded their comments more "peacefull" (without namecalling etc etc)?&gt;Eh... That's actually why I said he's not affecting others. He doesn't drive drunk (he has enough discipline to draw the line there, but not enough to quit, sadly) and he doesn't do hospitals. He's a sort of a... conscientious alcoholic, I guess?Ah, but you didn't say that in the other post though. But yeah, in that case, he isn't "really" hurting anyone else but wouldn't that be the same with a fat person that doesn't go to the hospital or just lives somewhere where no one sees him/her?
For someone who's trying to change beauty standards she sure does cake on more makeup than anyone I've ever seen
I'm still subscribed to both, but I typically skip over posts on my front page if I see FPS or FL attached to them. With FPS, I was tired of the hypocrisy of most of the authors. Too much "let's laugh at this gross bitch, she's 300 lbs, and I'm a fabulous 290 and working on it with a superhero boyfriend." The lack of self-awareness there drove me nuts.I feel like Fat Logic has turned into a weight loss/support group sub... which is fine, but that's not what I signed up for. I read a post today where a commenter was banned and told to go to FatPeopleHate if he wanted to be a dick... and it drives me nuts. It's the same hypocrisy that invaded FPS. They're "protecting" people while simultaneously talking shit about them. It's okay to mock Ragen Chastain or her followers, but it's not okay to mock someone for demonstrating equal fat logic in the comment threat. It's fucking nuts.

No, I think I misread your comment. I thought you were saying you miss when they do bans, implying that they don't any more.

"You can say nothing I have never heard before"."I bet I can... I love you".That's one of the best burns I've seen in a long time.
basically the same way sitting next to a ham does. they take up more space than they paid for, and they touch you/invade your personal space. in philly and nyc, men sit on public transportation with their legs spread so wide that they take up 3 seats, and even if you ask them to move they rarely do, or get pissy about it, and then you have to sit next to some cranky dude. i've had so many uncomfortable train rides with dudes spreading their legs out as far as they can so i have to angle in my seat or try to fold myself up so they aren't touching me. some dudes also use it as an EXCUSE to touch you.if there's no one sitting around them (and there usually isn't in the pics these women post!), big deal, but i dealt with this a lot on the subway in nyc and it was super annoying.
she must need at least 10k calories a day to maintain that size. why does her family keep feeding her? they could just hide her scooty and only allow her a normal amount of food. what they're currently doing is assisted suicide. I can't believe that this is legal while drug addicts go to jail.
I've used this insult before, but it is so true here. Her ass has its own ass.
Her voice is SO annoying.. Couldn't make it past 45 seconds.

Many landwhales think that making their eyebrows HUGE will somehow act as an optical illusion, making their fat faces look more normal sized. You're not fooling anyone.
It is exactly because of her weight, did you not pay attention to a word Dyolf_Knip just told you?? obesity and a lack of physical activity may increase the risk of an individual developing fibromyalgia.Fibromyalgia is notoriously used by people to game the system and attempt to "doctor shop" until they get diagnosed so they can claim disability and Social Security benefits early. I know that this is the case for a majority of the vocal "fibromyalgia" sufferers because I have met someone who admitted this to me when she was drunk enough. They take advantage of the fact that fibromyalgia sufferers as of yet have no discernible differences in their body that has been detected by modern medical science. There has not been any observations and no experiments thus far have been able to prove its existence, so they just made a disease name to describe the symptoms.People with real fibromyalgia probably are far less vocal about it because they actually wish they didn't have to suffer. The ones vocal about it are the ones most likely using it for attention and don't really have it. These people are scum and make it harder for people who actually have the disease.URLMuh FibermuhalgeaMuh GinethicsMuh Hydrothighroyism

Well, I guess a nice thing about being gay is that since you're both basically on the same level, as gay males, it's not like one of you can cry "Patriarchal Oppression!" or "Sexism!" to the other because everything that applies to them applies to you also. As a side note, I don't think it's pretty clear that judging by fat and fitness level is less shallow than Height or even Income (You have control over this but it's strongly affected by the family you were born into, and it's pretty hard to change)

I don't know about any of you other shitlords, but I find fat cats (or other pets) reaally disgusting. The owners are just forcing their lifestyle on the poor animal, when it has no say whatsoever, like the hamplanet who didn't want to walk with her dog so she made it fat so it wouldn't want to. That shit is pure and simple animal abuse.

In true hambeast fashion, she considers weight loss surgery instead of actually fucking exercising.Thank you for this, OP. I was greatly entertained by your post.
Awesome username. And I agree. Just because you aren't at home, doesn't mean you can just wreck a hotel room. They probably have the mentality that most people have in hotels that "Oh! the cleaning people will handle it" but come on. There's a limit for everything.

This is a quote from Chris Pratt about his weight loss. They need to shut the fuck up."When Guardians of the Galaxy was pitched to me, I said, "I don't think so." I just didn't picture myself getting the role. I didn't want to go and embarrass myself like I did when I auditioned for G.I. Joe a couple of years previously. I went in there, and halfway through I saw the director's eyes just glaze over. It made sense—I was a little heavy and out of shape. I was not gonna play someone from G.I. Joe. I did not look like a G.I. Joe action figure come to life."It's a thing when it becomes three peoples' job to mop sweat off of you. The hair person, the makeup person, an assistant. When their primary job becomes stopping you from sweating? But I sweat less now that I'm in better shape. When I was fat, it could be ice cold in a room and I would sweat."**It was getting to the point where I would wake up in the middle of the night and I wasn't breathing. A little bit of sleep apnea. My neck was pushing down on my throat, so my sleep felt like it was panicked all night.**"I like clothes now. I have more energy. I sleep better. My sex drive is up. Blood's flowing. I'm less susceptible to impulse. I'm in a different mode. When I was way out of shape, the idea of using whitening strips on my teeth seemed terrible. I have to do that every day? I'll never do it. What you want is instant results when you're out of shape. You want your teeth whitened in 45 minutes with the use of lasers. But when you're in shape, you know it's the result of doing a little bit every day. Moments aren't just moments. A moment might be a week or a month. So instead of Boy, I'd love to eat this hamburger right now, I'm considering a little further into the future. I'm thinking, I eat that hamburger and that's 1,200 calories, and I'm gonna work out tomorrow and lose 800 calories. I may as well eat a salad here, still do that workout, and then I'm actually making progress."You have to eat protein. You can't have hashbrowns, or burgers, or anything fried. You can't have carbs. You have to work out five times a week."But I can do 40-inch box jumps now. Action-hero physical stuff. Jumping that high feels really good. You see a giant hillside, and you think, I wanna get up that. You see a building, you think, I could climb that. When you get in shape, the world around you becomes things you wanna jump on and climb up."

I thought that was true of the cannabinoids in weed and not the THC specifically--hence the research on low/non-THC strains of marijuana. Have a source by chance?That being said, they do make THC pills called Marinol. Last time I checked it was mainly being used with AIDS patients to help them gain weight
The mcchickens have the same thing..Are you even listening? There's nothing wrong with fast food in and of itself. The key is a balanced diet, moderation, and exercise when appropriate. If you're 5lbs overweight, eat more fruits and vegetables. If your LDL cholesterol is too high, eat more fiber. It isnt difficult.

Nice gets overused to describe generally ugly/fat people that you don't want to say something mean about because you enjoy them as a person. There is only 1 guy in the world I describe as literally the nicest guy in history. And I follow it up with a lot more than just nice.Personally, I think most people get distracted with the notice that being nice is more meaningful than anything else. Rather than be a nice guy, be a good guy. Nice guys have good intentions but good guys have good actions.

Actually, I've heard it's happened before that some fatasses pretended to be FPH members and started brigading... A lot of the brigading could be fatties trying to get FPH banned.

When I first heard of the term 'body positivity' I thought it was about celebrating people who have birth defects, who were disfigured somehow from war or violence, little people, tall people, short people, people of all colors, etc. You get the gist. I'm cool with that. There are definitely instances when the differences between *healthy* bodies are out of the person's control. But I learned real quick that it is all about fat people (primarily women) who want to justify their gluttony, force the general populous to accommodate their girth and convince hot fit people to fuck them. Its disgusting.
Is....is that..honey? Dear God
...and there are fat people who decide to take responsibility and start losing weight. We still hate on them until they've managed to fix the mess they've made for themselves. I really don't see why my post is so controversial. I hate all extremes of unhealthiness equally.

I was living on the 20th floor of an apartment a couple years ago when we had a fire alarm go off. There was a lot of smoke coming out around floor five so my bf and I packed up the cats in their carrier and a backpack with my laptop and a few other things. I carried the cats and the back pack down to floor three before we were told we could head back up, so I turned around and headed back up the stairs carrying 30-40 lbs on my back and 20 lbs of cat and carrier on my shoulder. I was breathing pretty hard but it wasn't the worst thing and that's when I was still a bit overweight (around BMI 26-27). I can't imagine carrying an extra 100-300 lbs on top of all that. Ouch
I had a little, but thankfully I was a) young and b) only huge for four years, so I bounced back. My biggest insecurity are stretchmarks around my thighs/belly.

So I.. eat.. less.. calories.Poof.Not fat.It's easier than people make it seem.
I think failing to keep your mouth shut might be the reason she's in that disgusting state to begin with.
Motivation my wo/man. I will never be fat again, and this sub plays a part in that.
Mother of God, your dick would rot straight off.
This, and also why

I cleaned it up a bitM1 - your mass eg (75kg)M2 -hambeast/tumblerina/OP's mom (200kg)r - distance between you and fatfuck (~15m)g - constant that equals 6.67x10^(-11)So, (M1xM2xg)/(r^2) -&amp;gt; (75x200x(6.67x10^(-11)))/15^2Therefore Gravitational pull = ~4.45x10^(-9)N
This is one of the reasons i dont like eating out alot. The portions are so fucking huge i feel like im wasting money, and you get dirty looks from fat assholes when u leave food on your plate.
This person is not fat at all.
So beautifully worded, yet so infuriating
Yeah people love justifying weed. It's all the same to me.
I'm a very clean eater. I have no shame in my baked chicken breast and veggies.
There's nothing in your overview that shows you posted this. Got a link?
Oh please, I bet she still wishes she was dating Ryan Gosling.
We're shitlords, we're not meant to know the answer to that question.
Don't you know? It's funny to shame skinny people, but shame fat people and you're an asshole.
There is no way a fat ass can run.. It's going to fuck up its knees more than it already has. I think it's a troll.
She's actually just the "big-boned" youngest one.
No. That's what I mean with not believing in the death penalty. If I don't believe murderers should be put to death, I also don't think fat people should be put to death. I don't like the 'an eye for an eye' method. Just because someone else is a murderer doesn't mean I should be one. Two wrongs don't make a right.
28 inch waist... if she lifts up the flab...
It's times like this that I catch myself thinking: "maybe mandatory euthanasia wouldn't be so bad after all". I wish I didn't share a planet with people this dumb.

So many things to disguise yourself as: a hippo, a large boulder, uhhh, yeah that's about it.
I read (wouldn't recommend it) that too, not only did her stupid ass say that, but she went out of her way to say they were "conventionally" (i.e. NOT FATTIES) attractive. Where's the fucking disconnect!

Gross, that breakfast tho. I thought that was a shot glass of Orange juice but then I realized no, its just an enormous fucking full sized dinner plate that dwarfs the oj by comparison.
they reaaally outta just take medicare away feom fat fucks
Don't, then they'll feel appreciated and we can't have that
When I read these, in my head is a litany of ," no you aren't. No you don't. No you aren't. Says who? No you aren't. SHUTUP. No you aren't."
She lost some weight. But then decided to pierce her lip, instantly neglecting results.
&gt;slimy lima bean&gt;extra cups of mayoIf I ever need to induce vomiting audibly, you are my go to. that is fucking foul.
Guess she's not secure in her body after all eh?
Interesting...
There are torsos smaller than her thigh
"No, don't worry I'll fit.""Sir/madam/beast, please, it has a weight limit of 200""You know that's just for lawsuits and stuff right? It can handle me, trust m--" CRASH
Right? I'm in the military and will alway asks and if no discount is available, I'll just shrug and say "Always worth a shot!" Yet these fat useless leeches EXPECT a benefit that they didn't even earn?
Walk at a leisurely pace to get away!!
That sounds like such a fucking nightmare
Look like the parking lot of an industrial complex
Uh, yeah? My family has known that for years. We rehydrate onions when we want to make imitation McBeetus burgers at home lol.

That's between me, the professor, and the internet.
And also 3 tri-tip and fries...
I'm within normal weight. I did recently stop my running regimen and start lifting. Id like to hit 160 by the start of the fall semester. I was 130 when I graduated high school =0
Then they lose weight from lack of McBeetus. Its a win-win
Came here to say exactly that. You don't need to diet when your entire day is spent trying to find enough food to get you by until tomorrow. That's how most humans spent their days up until about 500 years ago.
Its like seeing a classic car rotting away on someones driveway. It could have been great but its fucked now.
Aren't you essentially stuck with forking over the money for all the people who don't have insurance, anyway? Once they end up in ER, or simply claim disability due to being unable to move, the costs are distributed amongst the taxpayers.Without universal health care you just end up paying more, the hambeasts burden you either way.
Skipping rope is the most effective cardio and all you need is a $5 rope.
That photograph was unpleasant.
Anyone know what the guy is doing behind his back?
I mean, you know this is super photoshopped, right? Like the zoomed in part isn't even from the same picture; the "flies" are in different spots and the pants are clearly not the same.This is kind of a boring repost, idk.
There needs to be a tag more severe than NSFL for things like this.
She looks like one of those girls that would be really pretty if she weren't fat.
What fat logic? Are you fucking handicapped? What is up with this sub today. Everyone is being stupid as fuck. Plus, look at all the fat fucking basement dwellers downvoting a post because I told simple FACTS about PCs. The fucking fatties are out in force today.
That's the grossest thing ive seen on reedit today and I sub to /r/wtf.
Surely less than a mile.
"If I deny reality, reality will reshape itself into a form I find more acceptable!"
ELI5: What exactly are brigading or vote brigading?
As long as he's not doing this method - "sneaking" things into food, as that's one of the major fears of many people with anorexia. They believe that their friends and family members are sneaking butter and sugar and calories into their food, so they refuse to eat even extremely low calorie foods like celery and lettuce. So, I really hope your friend is not sneaking anything into her food if she's recovering from anorexia :\
That shitty weave makes it even WORSE.
Don't super models have to walk all the way down the runway and back?
put some plastic down first. problem solved.
I laugh every time I think what would happen to these people if they grew up in our grandparents' generations. They'd be ridiculed mercilessly and told to quit whining, that nobody gives a shit about their feelings, and get to work making something of yourself.
I don't target any possible gender more then the other one, I just lump them all into one category. Excessive lumping.
I love you, Colorado. You tried.
It's all our fault. We suck...
The box of shells is over there on the table. Help yourself after I ----
Oh man and they will be all fat logic based. And the fats will all consign and kiss her ass. Which could take all year
Funny, this fat turd didn't think it was a pretentious, douchebaggy place when he/she was getting ready to GO to said place, waited in line, and was just about to start paying $14 for a rum a coke...justsayin
Looks like she wants to eat the camera.
FTW
Also, they are only allowed to kill the oldest ones that can't produce, whom also inhibit the herd/pack/whatever's ability to make more endangered animal babies. At least that's the rule in most large African hunting associations. So actually, getting rid of the very old that hurt chances of birth actually helps the lion population by keeping all the players in tippy top shape. The hunters tend to be fat rich fucks because..you know. Fat rich fucks are the only people that want to kill lions.
Mum dad pls don't fite
Who would get this guy as their PT? Isn't the fact that he is not in shape himself a good indication of the 'training' you are going yo receive? Jesus....
this disturbs me
A literal beach ball. Wow.
They are well done, after all don't tattoo artists practice with pig skin when they are apprenticing? Lol
I did. I haven't been able to work out in about 3 weeks. :( It's been stabbingly painful doing any of the things I used to do, so my OB/GYN has advised me to take it easy. It's frustrating because I miss running everyday and lifting.
I agree
Hey there was a problem with your verification... you need to send it again. To me. Just like the last one.

Shit, my bad.
When a group of skinny girls had the fat friend/DUFF most attractive guys didn't want them to bring the fat girl around. The skinny girls would say "Oh just let her come, she's nice &amp; has a great personality" as a way of selling other guys on just accepting the beast.
They should make that hamplanet pay for his own plane, no one should have to suffer a flight next to that

I have also eaten an old french fry before, out of a McDonalds bag. I was probably five.
Is that a website or the reason there's a padlock on your cellar door?
When did vaguely looking in the direction of a fat person become fat shaming?? She also claims she doesn't know what they're thinking about her but makes it pretty clear she thinks they're judging her negatively based on weight???
More like deep-fried refried beans

The scariest thing is that in the approximately 100 pictures of her ass she took for this, THIS was the most flattering.

He knew what was coming and noped the fuck out before it was too late.
Who do these fat sacks of shit think they are fooling when they eat salads in public?
They may have binge eating disorder, but that's not what I'm talking about at all. I'm talking about when they go on a diet for a few weeks, don't lose weight, then go back to stuffing their faces and talking about how they overcame "anorexia." It's the difference between consciously injuring yourself for years because your brain is telling you to, and eating extra cookies when you're sad. My point is, fat people use the word trigger to refer to anything remotely unpleasant that happens to them, and people who are actually triggered by past traumatic events are no longer taken seriously because of it.
You can keep that silly fat wanker, the lads can't lift him - bricktop
Wouldn't matter, they'd just keep eating till they were "full"
I live by a weird McDonalds where all the customers are thin. Reason? It's in a subway station. It has no seats or tables and is always lined up out the door. It's filled with people who use public transit, which means they have to walk a lot and are limited to buying what they can comfortably carry (which is probably why I've never seen someone get a supersized drink there).It weirded me out at first, but now I'm so used to it that I get thrown off when I see people sitting at McDonalds like an actual restaurant.
Why?
Ahh I see, thanks.
...I don't know whether to be happy that I matched this based on intuition, or whether to be disgusted by the fact that I see shit like this all of the time in Walmart.
Shouldn't be that hard to follow. Just walk the trail of broken horses.
Skinniest? Obviously NotFattest? Debatable
Ha, true, and I definitely feel a bit antsy and lame if I haven't done anything physical in a couple days. At that point, I'll at least jump on my bike and ride around the neighborhood for an hour.
That documentary was what made my husband finally stop drinking soda. I've been trying to get him to stop for 6 years of explaining how horrible it is for you.Only beef I have with the documentary is that it kind of gauges from blaming the people and straight up targets the corporations. I took it as a victim doc. toward fat people after awhile as it shifted the blame.
They crush everything from burros to burritos.
&gt; However, since it's such a rare condition, it's more likely that she simply hasn't washed her vajayjay in a long time.No, they ALL have it, it's not their fault they stink, it's genetics.
Her piercing makes my nose hurt
Actually, I thought saying there was nothing you could do was pretty shitlordy for a non-confrontational person. You'll get there :3
Forget that, they'll need Bagger 288 itself for that job.
that girl i guess ate herself to sleep during 3rd grade english when they were going over then/than. fucking stupid fatties.
This park is actually in Arlington. Same rule applies though, for the most part.
Music is my everything. False. You also enjoy food immensely.
The delusion is real. I'm with you. If their form isn't solid they should be practicing the basics with a plastic tube or something. I've seen cross fit coaches that do this for months before allowing people to touch a bar. Sadly not enough of them it seems.
Are you 150lbs? Unless you think being fit means being a skeleton there's no way you only consume 2000lbs at 6'1 and fit.
She doesn't sweat, she caramelizes...
/r/badspellinghate
I share your pain. I am a follower of the swoly iron path and have seen one of my family members posted on this thread recently. As much of a good person as she is, I am upset with how out of control her eating habits have become and even tho I try to be swole of heart, I can't find it in myself to break the news. I hope you are able to be stronger than I and are able to help your loved ones take a different path in life.
You don't think you're telling a story to us? The stories in TalesOfFatHate aren't just fiction.
This is a great idea- however, I used to participate in the EBT program when I lived in another state. This state let me be on food stamps without having to work 20+ hrs/wk as a student (some states assume you have a meal program at school, so they make it harder on you). I was in a very stressful program, so I didn't have the time to work 20+ hrs and I didn't have a meal plan. When I get stressed out, I lose my appetite. Without the EBT program, I know I would have wasted away. I went through times where I would literally be at 95 lbs (I'm 5'3.5ish"). Then at the end of the semester or after midterms or something, I would try to eat more while in between tests or projects if I could.I'm sure there aren't as many in my situation, but basically what I'm getting at is, there are times where I need to consume more than 2000 cals/day to up my weight as best I can before I go through another stressful time trying to study for finals or complete a project. If I don't have an opportunity to gain a few pounds, I go from 95 to even lower if I don't have that food. I think there should be a way to prove you're not overweight by requiring a doctor's visit. Most doctors weigh you every visit, right? Then doctors should submit documentation of height and weight. I don't think you should be automatically denied if you consume more than 2000 or that 2000 should be the limit for everyone.And limits on what can be purchased is a good idea too. Part of my struggle to keep my weight up is the simple fact that I am not willing to resort to junk/fast food. I could easily go that route and be at my target weight, except yuck. :( No one needs that gross, processed food. My state also lets you get fried foods from 711. I can't even look at that shit.I know what I'm doing is not healthy either. I can't really help that heightened stress makes me lose my appetite though. I am a petite person anyway, but I have been as low at 85 lbs at one point and the plan I have established keeps me from going below 95lbs, so I consider that success.
I have a feeling those piercings get infected often...
can some post the channel name here, the link is fucked for me.
Saaame. I used to tumble, lost most of the function in both vestibulocochlear nerves, and learned to longboard :) Its one of the few things I can do from vision. Just curious, I have ridiculous problems getting skinny jeans on over my calves, is that normal? D:
Jezz, I want more fb friends like you!
That was my next guess. If the counselor told the truth the fatties would say "Today" was fat shaming.
I don't think this shit is limited to GWCURVY. Anybody who comments on porn with anything other than "source" have not and never will see a vagina in person.
I'd argue a different species after a certain weight threshold. Is blob a species? It should be.
Great job on losing some weight and taking responsibility for yourself and reaping the benefits.
Some people back in my home country are working their ass off even with 1 leg, 1 arm, both legs or both arms gone. And here we have a giant couch potato made out of lard and not starch refusing to be of use.. What a disgrace to the human race.
Soapy bubbles?FOAM PARTY!!!
I'm sure rocks can swim more gracefully than that beast
Anyone who'd trust them with their health deserves what they get.
It's pretty pathetic to try to brag about penis size online...especially if you aren't remarkably large, which you aren't
I always get weird looks when I take a bite out of them, so I just slam the entire thing sliced between some bread and add pepper, salt, and some ketchup. You'd be surprised at how fucking delicious that is.
If I had an anaconda, it would definitely not want none.
Man...I can't even muster anymore hate. This was a human being at some point, somebody's daughter, she might be a mother. Jesus, what selfish, inattentive fuck allowed this to happen? Fuck this beast.
I guess I must be a shitlord
And the subreddit title does not answer the question?
I loved this game it was so cute. The princess was thin in the game but your opponent fed her cake to get fat to make it hard to rescue her. But if I remember she did go back to normal lol.
She is fat and if that is her man he is a lard ass as well.
Martin lawerence loves to dress like a fat woman. Thats about as close as youll get
Ha ha ha ha I know this girl. She's tried to hit on me several times. She's an ex of a friend of mine though so I keep saying I wouldn't do that to him, but in reality he wouldn't care. I just think she's fat and fugly.
Love it!
Facts don't dispute MUG GENETICS. Commenting for later use :OK_hand:
I haven't broken any rules. But I expect to be banned anyway. Like a fat-ass confronted with the realities of her lifestyle, certain people react to the topic of race with irrational, emotional hysteria. Not that I even introduced the topic here. I didn't bring /r/coontown into it.This is why I didn't use my regular fatpeoplehate account.
Wow I'm very sorry about that English is not the first language but what did I misspelled?
It's an inside joke my boyfriend and I have together. We splurge once a month and just eat like shit for a whole day. We call it Diabetic Delight Day. In all honesty, the craziest we get is ordering pizza and eating ice cream.
I do. It's the only way my hands can keep up with my brain
I love the jump from "few extra pounds" on to "inches". The beast in the photo looks like a stand in for My 600 Pound Life. I bet she still has "no fetish blogs" tagged on her tumblr
He knew he was fat and knew exactly why. He knew it was unattractive and managed to get a comedic angle on it. The best examples of fat people to hate are the ones in /u/Atchung_Shitlord's posts.
Sweetest Christ, it's been a while since I was here and those legs scared me. I might avoid NSFW tags until I re-adjust to the content here.
Is the NASA stamp there to qualify it as a new super planet? I think I can see some redshift going on.
But would it? You're speaking against an "oppressed class" of people, therefore you're "not allowed a say, shitlord".
I don't think they'd ever find anyone to work there. I don't care how much more they were paying, it would not be worth the torture.
Ok as someone who used to be a happy fat fuck and is now a happy average fuck I can safely say, that it is reaaaally fucking simple to slim down. (Also free!) So no excuses, C25K is waiting!
It'd be a lot easier for these obeasts to lose weight than anything that they claim to do. They just don't have the self control for that.
At first, I was stunned that they're eating right from the box and drinking right from the bottles of soda. But then I realized that there's actually no space on the table for cups or plates due to that gargantuan pizza.Thin privilege is not needing insanely large tables in order to have room for dishes and silverware.
Ah the classic, you need a big dick to "handle" a fat. You know whalebeasts probably think this because only chubby chasers have ever been able to get it up around them.
I love how long it takes to pull the curtain. They left her on display for a while.
Guys, could we please stop with calling the girl "skinny", "thin" and "slim"? She's hot and very healthy-looking, but she only looks skinny next to the ham. It's just a little unfair to girls who are actually slim[this is skinny](URLget your shit together fatpeoplehate
So you're fat?
I kind of feel bad for the guy his mom is a corpulent narcissist and will likely destroy every relationship he forms with other women just to keep him in her ham paws.

It's often a sad end for "mini pigs" (If this is one) They stay cute for a while and then grow up and gets hard to accommodate..

How did they get there anyways?
Some of those fuckers are so fat they get out of breath just standing still.

So?Banned.
Eating seems to be the only thing its body knows how to do.
Maybe. Console players are subbed to PC Master Race, so...
Edit: Terrible english. This happened a couple of years ago. Someone reblogged a video of her dancing in a bikini. I don't remember the exact words but I wrote in spanish something like this is disgusting, I never seen a woman this fat in my life. She read my post and I guess she translated it because then I received a very angry message from her and also she instigated her followers to do the same.It was very silly but I didn't know how to react so I deleted my tumblr.She alway says that is very confident and that she loves herself and her curveees, but everytime she posts something she follows obsessively who reblogs her pics and what they write about her. A confident woman doesn't translate a random spanish message in a video that had more than 500 notes.
Seems to be partial to one side of the argument too
wuuuuuuutwut
Not sure why but this reminds me that in my Drug Addictions and Behaviors class, the professor was talking about food addictions and was like "Yeah, there about 4 of you who clearly have a food addiction and should probably switch majors." It was so funny.
I'm thinking marathon is some kind of unfathomably large Greek dish, like one of those hamburgers that can be sliced up like pizza. She ate half of it.

Something I've noticed about fat people: Food is their number one concern. It takes precedence over everything. It is all they think about it. What they're eating now, what they will be eating later, what tastes good, how much of it they can shovel into their blackholes, etc. I don't think their is any one thing in my life that I obsess over the way fat people obsess over food. Yeah, they were flirting with your candy. Because from their warped perspective, everyone is as in love with food as they are.
You and me both, OP! It's a perfect way to wind down at the end of a long day.
Except we love all genders, sexual orientations, and races here. We don't blame people for stuff they can't control. Weight is something you absolutely CAN control, and these lazy fucks choose not to.
I know. I want so bad to comment. But I'm big time banned from that group.
Well, they're busy drowning themselves in diet soda.
Doesn't look like you're gonna have to wait too much longer!
&gt;I'm black, thus I avoid racist subs because I know they'll piss me off.Does that mean black redditors are not planning on killing innocent black people and leave a message saying "Coontown send me" to get them banned from reddit?Next you are going to say women on reddit aren't planning the murders of innocent women and leaving a note with the message "the redpill send me", smh you talk like avoiding a sub is even possible shitlord, clearly murder is the *only* reasonable choice. /s

Dresslink is one that I like. Shipping can be anywhere from a few bucks to like 20 depending on the service you choose. Don't be afraid of ebay!! Just make sure the seller has a good rating. I get stuff shipped free from ebay all the time that would have been a good 10 bucks from other sources! Ebay is also great for hair accessories and costume jewelry.
Oh my god! I'm a a hairstylist. 1 has my coworkers and me laughing our asses off right now! People are asking about your hair cuz it looks like a 5 year old styled it in the dark for you after you washed it in the toilet! You made our day achtung!
Really, a large big Mac meal has 1300 calories. If it's all you eat that day you probably won't have to do any running to burn it off.
Like this. They throw a temper tantrum and Big Daddy government changes it. Excellent use of taxes.
dankmeme^tm
depending on what kind of clothes he gets / how skinny he is / how he washes them it can be a bit of a nightmare around that height.It's just tall enough that "tall" clothes are too long.Thank god shitlord brands like american apparel and urban outfitters exist in the usa still.For some reason people expect tall guys to be fat as fuck.
No no no no no no no. I do not need nor want that image, ever. No.
It said on the website that if they don't reach half-way by a certain time they'll be re-routed to a modified track. (Juice verifies this apparently haha).And why walk? Ughh hate some people. And thank you very much ^.^

My favorite part of this is where she poses the hypothetical "what if you told a child this, they'd be devastated and embarrassed" scenario. You're not a fucking child, but you think it's okay to behave like one? Grow the fuck up, show some accountability for your nasty fucking body, and change it.
Saaame. My grandma (80 pounds and subsists on ice cream and coffee) is always like "DO YOU WANT SOME ICE CREAM"... no. For the last time. I don't live on ice cream I eat actual food. Though I do share her coffee habit.
Its disgusting but at least its not a MySpace angle
I feel that even tho we are adults and are capable of discomforts, we need to start reporting this shit like the fatties surely would if the shoe was on the other foot. If we cannot stand up for ourselves or, God forbid, retaliate, we are just allowing ourselves to be victims.
Textbook definition of OP delivering. Thank you, like a bunch.
I'll keep wearing my skirts, fly them like flags!
Agreed. Underweight shitlord and just because I'm a feminist doesn't mean I approve of fat people. Body positivity≠fat acceptance

I just looked at photos of a 50 year-old man climbing the frozen Niagara Falls with primitive equipment. Greatest machine indeed. Yet when people willingly treat their own perfect machine like a hybrid beanbag-garbage disposal, I am supposed to enable their delusions or risk getting called a "hater" or sexist.

I don't know if nothing tastes better than skinny feels, but nothing tastes worse than fat looks.This broad, for instance, looks worse than licking a shit-covered car battery.
Respectfully disagree. When I got serious about losing weight I immediately cut out anything bad for me and dropped to 1200-1300 calorie days. As I made visible progress I slowly worked my way back to having some days where I ate more, 1700-1800 calories, as a way to satiate cravings and keep morale up instead of denying myself anything really good for months on end. I would imagine the really deluded fatties to not see enough progress quickly enough with your method, further supporting their diets don't work mentality.
Why are his legs so skinny when he's so fat??
Make them eat donuts while we do pushups.
Read the comment carefully again. I'm not sure how you did not get what he was saying.
It seemed you were done, so glad you're backing out.
And be tied to her in some regard.
I use the term human very loosely in this situation.

Because becoming a fat hag with a laundry list of emotional hang ups about men, sex, relationships, etc is *really* going to help women achieve what they want out of life. So we should all listen to a crowd of miserable, obese losers who project their own failures onto the people and things (attractive men, fit women, good sex, successful relationships, etc.) that exist as constant reminders to them of how ugly, undesirable and generally fucked up their lives are. And their lives are undesirable and fucked up because they became landwhales and now have to spend every waking moment rationalizing their gluttonous, hog-brained greed to everybody. And when their weak rationalizations inevitably fail, they simply ban the fit, healthy, and personally responsible people, all of whom, by their very existences alone, conclusively prove that hams are fucking failures in life.
I think I'd let it keep the stroller just to protect the child. If she's that desensitized to her own health how the hell can you trust her to carry around an infant without her throwing it down to grab some more kondishunz?
If your not surprised then why do you not leave?
Honestly? It s a huge problem with the millennial generation. They (we) grew up with everyone telling us "You can do anything! You can be anyone!" "You're *special*" "You're beautiful!" but failed to tell us that everything in life, **EVERYTHING**, requires hard fucking work. Yeah, most things might fall into place for you, but everyone can see you didn't work for jack shit and will never respect you.It applies to bodies too, its why half the people from college become hams two years after graduating.
They aren't the front most one's heels are literally about to give way.

Maybe one day we'll get some grainy footage of a person running a 6 minute mile who is fat.Years later it'll be debunked as a runner in a fat suit
People fall for this shit. Fat storage and metabolic function isn't magic. It's almost a fully developed science, we just have a few more mysteries to solve in regards to sub cellular processes but for all intents and purposes we know EXACTLY how much energy you consume and use down to the second.
That is super weird! All I can think is "stretched" is "might hold lard up to such and such before exploding"
D'awwww! How sweet! :D : D :D
In a gym I wear cons or some other flat shoe. At home I'm barefoot.
"Forcing kids to diet is child abuse"
If you're on a diet, you don't get to splurge.
Fage is the way to go. I get the 2% and a small serving of that has 20g of protein. Toss in some blueberries, and it tastes so good.
I have always hated fat people. Hell in 4th grade a fatty told the principal on me because I was shitlording him so hard. Little fucking pumpkin. Anyway I found out about this sub on the PKA podcast and it feels great
I last literally hours (not including for play) because i masturbate so much my penis is pretty callused lol
Are you implying those lard-monsters are human in some way? That's insulting to Mankind.
&gt;even if i fucked my lipstick this morningit must suck when you have to keep crying for sexual attention and reminding yourself and others that you can have sex
It's like she skipped the bag of cheetos and went straight for the novelty leopard himself... who then went straight to her thighs.
This pissed me off so much. A picture of a fucking scale made it to the front page, seriously? Showing 300 goddamn pounds none the less. What a joke.
People should start making things like this that say stuff like "stoping pretending you're healthy and making up excuses because you're lazy and have no self control over what you put into your mouth."

I hate how blogs have become 'informative articles' for fatties.
Yeah maybe when btc were worth like 1300 dollars now they are worth like 200
Honestly that's actually not as bad as it seems. Your average deep frozen pizza has 800 calories, so she only had one. She definitely has a caloric deficit, so she would be losing weight. Granted, there are healthier ways to diet, and this wont be good for her blood vessels etc., but at least she is trying.
That sub is fucking bullshit. "6 month progress! Down from 550 to 547!!!!!!!!"
Fuck her for being fat.Fuck her for trying to lose weight.eyy lmao guys.
Dear merciful quad. I'll have to give some a shot.**EDIT**: [Now it exists](URL
The only discrimination is the fact that society has to bear the burden of these selfish, fat fuck-faces. Personally I think that if you have no restraint, no pride, and no willpower then you should receive no help from the rest of society. Any person that can't stop eating until they're disabled is nothing but a beast driven by excess and is fundamentally a waste of resources, time and space. They should be given up on much like they gave up on their ability to be a benefit to the community.
Sharing it is ridiculous. Recent research has shown that when someone tells another merely their plan to do something good, the brain is rewarded as if they actually did it. The advice that came out of this was if you have a goal, keep it a secret. Tell no one else. Things like my fitness pal, Facebook, IG, and others are all just a form of self enabling. One doesn't actually need someone else to say they have done well. They just did it for themselves. Now time to celebrate the good intentions with a cheat day. Fucking fatties.
I agree except for the sweat part. Even knowing that it's purified I would barf knowing it came from a fatty. Instead just have all the sweat gather in one place and run pass a turbine. Then we'd get even more power.
Feeder? He's making it pretty clear he wants to get huge himself.

This is the most honest and agreeable sub I've been to. We don't apologise for who we are or what we believe. You get exactly what it says on the tin. And yet we're a drop in the ocean of fat tumblrinas braying about how they are oppressed worse than 1880s Russian jews because they don't make this one skirt in size 26.
I know. Animals don't lie. They wear their emotions on their sleeve and are so sensitive to their environments. It sickens me when a demented Chunkosaurus poisons they're already short lives. And the worst is when they think the dog wants to eat cakes and cheeseburgers like them cause they're sooooo gooood. /s
It looks like they could just drag it back into the ocean
Banned for being a fatty mc fatass.
Red Velvet cake is the best cake. Happy birthday, OP!
That's insane. I can't find my ring size in jewelry stores usually. Apparently a 4 is some insanely thin size that no one wants. It's probably not in very high demand because of all the fatties in the wild.
If you do end up having children, (by choice, not sabotage by monster-in-lard) let's all hope that hog kicks the bucket before the first baby comes along.
I have read that the insatiable hunger symptom of Prater-Willi begins around puberty. It also doesn't occur in every case. Whether this letter is a real thing with a real kid remains to be seen there is at least a 50% chance it was concocted by some childless high-school student looking for attention. Redditors can be that trollish
I can neither confirm nor deny this.
Juggalo are pretty much always fat so this is a catch all.

I think they'd need some sort of pulley system.
I have a theory about this. Fat clients are usually very intimidated about the gym. Trainers are even scarier of you don't know anything about exercise, especially if they look like a trainer is supposed to look like. However, a fat trainer isn't scary. They understand. They know the struggle. And they will coddle the shit out of the client. This makes the client feel secure. The gym books more clients, thus making more money. Just a theory. I would love to hear other thoughts.
I hate her drawn on eye brows. And her tattoos. She has made 0 good decisions in her life up to this point.
They should call it fat fishing because only fat ugly people do it.
Wow...she really wants those MySpace angles to work for her.....but there isn't a camera angle in the *world* that can help her ass.....
Dead.

I will be extremely pissed at the universe if she survives this. My grandfather (fit as a fiddle at age 72 after serving in the RAF) developed pneumonia from an infected line from his last chemotherapy session, which put his bowel cancer in remission but ultimately ended up killing him within a few days. If someone who has eaten themselves into pneumonia by their late 20s is able to survive that which killed my grandfather at the end of his cancer treatment in his 70s, I will be extremely disappointed by human biology.
It doesn't even look like he'd be inside her! She's probably just grinding against his malnourished bones. Poor woman starved and fucked him to death.

Ugh at least soon it will be cold and the fats will have no choice but to cover up. Hopefully.

"What do you mean it's not normal to wipe my ass with a rag on a stick?"
I imagine it wouldn't take long working in a store catering to fatties before you started to see them as less than human, even less than mammalian.
They have not yet become sentient. If they ever do, they might learn a thing or two.
Well hiring strongmen isn't cheap. I immagine thor and eddie hall would be up to the challenge though.
I'm really surprised that she has that cattle nose-ring and brightly colored hair. What a quirky, curvy goddess!
Wait! Can you get abs this way too?!?! Why the fuck have I been wasting all that time exercising?
Nonono you guys don't seem to understand.She has a *boyfriend*That means she's super hot and better than every single personAhem.
Let's hope. She just made a half gallon of hot chocolate for her drink with dinner so its looking like the latter. I just went up to my room to avoid watching and I keep asking myself where the fuck she found hot chocolate and in that quantity?
Honestly, you could feel the calm sweep over us.
If you weren't verified I'd ask if you were new here. Some of these hams are convinced they're objects beauty.
Speceboya!...? Again I refuse to Google or use Russian letters
Interesting. I might convert!
It texts and calls and does Reddit, so I am satisfied.
Look at the fatty in the backgrounds face hahahaha
The miss piggy tattoo on her forearm made me sad for some reason. And want to throw up a little. This sub is a roller coaster of emotion.
The only possible way is if it was born on the subway.
Since when is this is any way offensive or shaming anyone? If anything, it's motivating people to get in shape. If those hypocritical hamplanets can attack this harmless ad, then we shouldn't be getting shit from them about hating on their "Fat Acceptance" and "HAES" bullshit. Goodness, they were already terrible enough, now they have to impose double standards also. Such a shame.
Shitlord Photoshop, this shit old as hell
switch the ()s and the []s.
It's diet based, if you're gonna go nuts on sugary foods it will happen. Which usually happens with fat women.
I believed all of that.
Here's the thing, they are trying desperately to convince themselves that what they say is true. Think about it, when is the last time you made a post exclusively to tell the world how good you felt about yourself? I genuinely do love myself and feel good about who I am as a person, but I don't think I've once voiced those opinions because I just cannot imagine the use of doing so. I know how I feel, I'm secure in that, and really there's no point in going farther than that. The ones you see posting status after status are buying into the idea that if you repeat a lie often enough it eventually becomes truth.
Ooh no hamphobia, they put "personal" photos here on FPH they shared on social websites, what on earth are we gonna do about this gigantic (hehe) problem?
Sadly, this is how I am. I'm gifted in the brains department, but for some reason I completely missed out on the glorious blessing of eloquence. I'm about as articulate as a mushroom.

I found a bike at our gym yesterday that is basically like playing a video game of cycling through the mountains. It makes stationary cycling a lot more fun, which is important because everything is mud, snow, and ice around here right now. If I do the right rides, I can butn 750-1k calories in an hour, which is pretty close to what I burn on the single track around here. What I'm trying to say is that a large Bacon Cheeseburger pizza sounds fucking amazing right now.
These hams all seem to have that dead, lifeless expression. Further evidence that being a disgusting glutton just saps the life right out of you.
Christ they can't even be honest with themselves let alone someone who may potentially be interested in them...until they find out that their a lying fat fuck!!

&gt;Everyone faces decisions in life where you logically KNOW the right decision, but you don't always make it because you're selfish and it's easier to not make the right decision.That's true, but there also should be accountability for those decisions, regardless of what they are. The right thing isn't always easy.

Why read their own sources when they can spend that sweet sweet time eating a turkey dinner for 6?Why would you spend your time reading BOOORIING sources if you could have Thanksgiving all over again instead?!Priorities, shitlord. *priorities*
You seem to have no idea about dieting. Don't tell me about food being expensive, because I'm a college student with no problem with gaining weight. Read something about IIFYM and check subs like r/fitness, r/gainit.
It took her a year to learn the overhead MySpace pose??
I study in Starbucks for a few hours three or four days a week, and it's amazing to see the blatant self-selection in action.Young, fit women come in to grab coffee and chat? Whatever they get, it's a tall, and it's never a frappucino (even though it's recently become stupidly hot in East Texas).A solitary seacow saunters in to study? Venti frappucino, and then another when they're finished; repeat ad nauseum (literally) until they get tired of acting like they're studying when they've really been on Facebook for three hours.Men are more of a crapshoot since I guess they see frappucinos as girly or something, but bigger guys always get venti and skinny guys always get tall or grande.
Also forcing its feet together to look slimmer.

Oh, you really should change your flair to something like "frau apache-shitkin"This made me giggle.
**CONGRATULATIONS ON DECIDING TO BE FUCKING NORMAL**oh wait, I don't care. It's really not that hard to lose weight, just have some fucking self control.

She's hot, not matter her age.
No, she's not going to succeed. The only way people like this will ever change is if they completely admit to themselves that they are so fucking wrong that they need some help. And then they have to pledge not to argue with that help.

Stay strong, shitlord. I've had this happen to me on a 7hour flight. This ogre of a man (over 6ft and about 400-500lbs) was so fucking huge his fat was spilling over and under the arm rest and onto my thigh. There's me, barely 100lbs soaking wet, just sat there mortified at having to prod his sweaty arm every time i wanted to put in/take out the tray.
oh shit...yeah that'll do it.
that was one of the most horrific things I've ever watched. That guy is her HUSBAND?! and she's ONLY 24!? I thought it was her kid or something.. what the fuck. just what the fuck!?good article though
Nice. Six feet under, because running a few miles and not stuffing your face with twinkies is some kind of challenge
Wait is her real last name actually Holliday??? I'v been referring her as Tess Munster to people.LMFAO.
Ahh that looks like a better place for this. Thanks! Idk I've tried that myself and it didn't even phase her. But I'm sure as hell going to keep trying. One more slap just for you!
This might be the cutest thing I've ever read.
This is why I love being a shitlord ex-pat. I'm 4,000 miles from these family gobblings and have no food obligations to attend. I used to hate how food was such a big deal with my fat, middle class dad (250 ish lbs) - our nightly dinner saga could go on for hours, with cheese and wine and all this pompous shit. Only reason I stayed within a normal BMI was because I cycled to work everyday (and even then he'd try to persuade me to take the car). Fuck, thinking about it now he's a proper hamplanet cunt.
Oi!
Yeah, I'd say the first pic is a more tolerable form of fat (as opposed to the second pic); she can easily come back from that with some effort. However, the second pic is atrocious.
Well, that settles it. They said no homo, therefore no homo. Perfectly straight.
I remember when I used to tumble. I would get on the high bounce trampolines at the gym I went to (there were five of them and they were mounted in the ground! :D As well as a double mini and a tumble track and a tumble track-trampoline thing) It was AMAZING until a fat chick literally went through one of the high bounce trampolines embedded in the ground... The hole was actually pretty deep because, being high bounce, they have to have a lot of room for them to stretch. So she fell straight through to the concrete and broke her leg... Trampolines DO have weight restrictions.
Yeah, exactly. He gives off a complete creeper vibe. I would definitely *definitely* not want him to have my or my friends' instagrams at hand.
He most definitely shit after that.
You know...This is a problem North Korea probably never has to deal with...

Lived in Japan for 5 years, can confirm that they silently HATE fat people, examples are always found in the design. Public bathrooms are designed for you to squat to go 2 (photo below, no worries, SFW/L), but "western" bathroom designs can be found, but still have narrow stalls. Condos/houses have very narrow hallways, have small rooms and the furniture (tenants ass) to fill these homes are designed to accommodate the normal Japanese body type and condo size. Seats on public transportation are narrow, aisle ways are narrow and cars are designed very slim. Meals are served with a real proportion, other than at a "Brazilian" themed steak house.Some photos for your viewing pleasure shitlords and shitladies:Standard Dinner: URLFAMILY Car: URLJapanese public toilet (SFW/L): URLAverage size living room/kitchen of condo: URLIt's a beautiful place :DEdit: Added SFW/L to bathroom photo

Aside from all the walking you described, that's gotta be one of the fattest things I've ever heard of. What happened to the 1L of water? Wouldn't surprise me if the ham just poured it out.
You look fucking terrible when you're doing animal impressions. But I guess that's a good thing.Quite pretty otherwise. Shocking difference, really.
TBF, giving them the extra seat if it's available probably saves someone else from having their lard spill into their personal space.

I've wanted to ask all the nurses/medical employees that come through my checkstand at work about stuff like this, but they're all fat themselves..... :X
Where to begin...I came here to hate on fatbags not look at them. But, I know for a fact that Jesus Christ himself would not have come back if only he'd known that Christianity meant a 2.99 buffet deal on Sundays where all the oversized lardroaches crawl in and leave their slime on every table, fork, spoon, ladle, napkin, and deep fried dish they can get their grubby porkers on. There is no longer such a thing as "atmosphere" in a restaurant because it's being loudly inhaled and exhaled by the fatmonglers coming in and ruining a perfectly good, cheap Sunday meal.
EMT here. You know those van ambulances a lot of services are switching to to save money? Well have i got a tale for you. We got a call to pick up an LB800+ eat beast from a local facility and take them to a doctor 's appointment. Turns out the patient has a flesh eating fungus colony between what used to be her thighs that they couldn't stop from progressing deeper into the legs because her legs were already splayed soooo far apart due to the fat that the wouldn't open any more to let the area dry out. Any way, it was the middle of july a few years back during a heatwave, and we were transporting this beast to a specialty care doctor to see if she STILL HAD PULSES IN HER FEET. So it took 8 EMTs to move the lil dumpling and i got stuck in the back of the truck teching the call. Wanna talk about smells? I swear it smelled like the porta potties at woodstock mixed with dog shit. I swear i can still smell that monstrosity to this day.... She seriously smelled worse than decayed bodies.

It is funny now that I look back at it (and now that I hate fat fucks with a passion). I was terribly shy and scared, and the move was a huge ordeal for the younger me. I was a timid young lady from TN who moved to CA completely alone for college. The fatty pressing me into the window was just my breaking point.
I'd probably go home with the guy in the thor costume tbh

I have a friend who sleep eats medication. She's actually called people in her sleep to ask where her pills are.One night she drank a 1/2 bottle of wine she had sitting in her room. She really needs to get that shit checked out.
Good. Suffer your triggers in silence.
I saw a gif one time of a different mushroom-like obese woman walking to a toilet. She needed a special ultra wide seat just to shit.

Especially after reading this trash.
I couldn't watch past "We hear that from doctors".Maybe there is a good reason that people who dedicate their life to improving people's health thing being a ham is not okay. If doctors can't get through to them, nobody will. Disgusting.
Why am I always right about this...?
I use 'tiny' to when talking to my shitlady friend because of her history. I think it helps to counteract the kind of shit she ends up taking from people about her weight and her insecurities about it. She always says she isn't (I know she's a healthy weight), but it's a button I get to press.I'm pretty sure she secretly likes it.For other people, I just don't call them fat, chubby, overweight, lardass, etc. Thin and skinny are the kinds of words I use to describe sticks. Anorexics and the like get called sickly or occasionally sticks. When I see a fit, healthy person, I'm thinking "oh, muscles" or "hello curves".
Your username is gold
Can we call them Tubblrinas instead?
Seriously, you can get away with a lot if you put a few years of your life into building some muscle density. Muscle burns a lot of calories.
You already banned me? Lol, I was gonna lurk, but *fiiiiine!*
Of course! Look at all of the hammies that came out of Auschwitz.
I'm an x-ray tech and (where I work at least) we aren't allowed to say anything that might upset the patient because it might negatively impact our hcahps scores and, in turn, affect our reimbursement. Some doctors have gotten in trouble for being "too blunt" with patients as well.Basically we've become a Holiday Inn with hospital beds and room service that includes someone wiping your ass. You might get one or two honest people who tell patients how it really is, but they usually aren't around long since our organization's policy is essentially that we're the patient's bitch.Edit: I should add that as a tech I'm not allowed to give a formal opinion on any form of medical care, or interpret the images I take. Everything like that has to be referred back to either the patient's nurse, doctor, or our radiologist. For example, is [this](URLWhat I do is image the patient and take a brief history as to why I'm doing the exam, while keeping the patient as comfortable as possible.
Oh, good! You're just about my height. I think I look best at about 120-125. That's where I'm a size 2. If you're willing to go that far, I'd recommend that as a goal for you.

Anyone so lazy and incapable of making even small changes to slowly lose weight over the course of years (stop drinking anything besides water, no diet shit, no coke zero, no fatfuckcola zero whatever, ditch caffeine as well because no one obese drinks it black, they pour a sickening amount of sugar and often more into it at minimum, here's an easy and common issue for most morbidly obese people that requires no exercise!) will just get fat again and have even more health problems than ever before.
they should be hosed down and deloused like incoming people to jail(going from what I've seen in movies, never been to jail)
So....they find it unbelievable that people would go 12 hours between meals? Wow Wow wow. Even without if, isn't that....normal? Ok when I work late I eat dinner @ 900-930. I usually get up around 10, workout, shower, and eat at around noon. Even a person working a 9-5 I assume would eat at say...700 (?) and then ....breakfast at about 8? Right? What's so unbelievable about this? Christ almighty no wonder this person is fat. Hope they never have to fast to get their blood drawn or before a surgery.
Give her 2 more years and 100lbs more, and that coke will become a diet coke. That will be her maximum effort to lose the weight. Diet cokes over regular.
When they are this fat you just fuck the belly button because every other hole is full of fat and completely hidden.
Don't be a hater. Intense dislike?!
Thin privilege is not having necrotic genetalia. I swear I think I see a purple pussy lip hanging out of that cavern.
So if we're ugly we can do this?
I knew what this would be. Clicked anyway.
The cake is a ship... sized one.
I'm sure they settled for some teriyaki or cream cheese rolls in the end.
The new avengers?
yeah, after james cameron raised the bar, kim kardaishian immediately lowered it.
Chicken salad is a salad, so it doesn't count!And they're still at it. Or a new one.
My bad, I will post over there!
Okay, that makes sense.
Wow, who is that?
The male ham was pissed this guy slept with his female ham. Let this be a lesson: DON'T FUCK FAT CHICKS.
It's like a reverse thigh gap.
Boring...go back to your poetry slam...
Possibly female as it looks like it's wearing lip liner.
It works less effectively on hams.
There's a reason clothing stores don't cater for these obeasts and that's because once you become a lump of lard you lose all human proportions. I'm surprised they can even find one piece of clothing that fits.
She also said that fat people smell like bacon, and skinny people smell like fireworks!
its good to want to get better. I am in better shape than most people, but I always try to get better. that being said, most people cant go up stairs without breathing hard haha. Sometimes I go through lazy periods, but that happens rarely and only lasts a few days and its due to drug hangovers lol.
THE FILTERS! THEY DO NOTHING!
"Being fat doesn't mean you're unhealthy" Well... I don't feel like im making assumption, saying she'll die young... and still leave a very ugly corpse
I fucking hate how large their navels are. It's disgusting.
Who're you calling pinhead?
Are you serious? O_o
Good, that is a welcome start.Next contribute and not just snipe other shitlord's contributions.
Probably because people like seeing it here? Don't know, didn't think it was mean or anything
Couldn't she just lay on her side?

I've done all sorts of broccoli soups and even before finishing one bowl I need some variety in the taste.
Or hyperphagia which can be caused by the infamous beetus.
Yeah, hospital food isn't that bad, but his posting is beyond ridiculous. A stroke most likely linked to his obesity, yet he still eats 1 year worth of calories after getting a minor stroke, and the only thing he thought of putting away is the fries and bacon.I think that stroke is the least of his worries.
A lot of women wish their butt would look good in jeans without pockets. Own it.
I thought they usually are?
You: Logic Her: WAAAH! I CAN'T HEAR YOU! WAAAAAAH!
I like how she says that we need to lead by example, but she won't address the fact that she's not leading by example when it comes to maintaining a healthy caloric intake.
Question for career aged shitlords;How do you deal with tubby, out of shape friends and colleagues calling attention to your body without giving away your shitlord tendencies?I am talking about all the food policing nonsense; constantly looking at you then spouting their insecure bullshit excuses; exclaiming about your weight, grabbing your waist, even picking you up if they're drunk enough.I am fine with being the smallest person in the room, but I feel like I'm in a zoo half the time because of it.
I will call out my trolls for assistance!
She should have turned the bra around and put her back tits in it....
2nd pic made me throw up in my mouth a bit.
I doubt it.
HOIST THE MOD ALL PRAY TO HIM
i'd ask the restaurant for cushions so a human could fit.
Oh buddy, I just left. The summer brings all the fatties out in droves. At least the fat hobos don't crowd the mta all night. That giant one at Nassau/fulton....could smell him for miles.
That's probably the only way he can find it

&gt; I don't think there was any photo editing done.In China, filters that make your skin porcelain-like, your eyes bigger and your chin narrower are quite common.If editing was done, it is most likely just such a filter.
Probably angry that there are no better things to sit on.
Must be pretty swole. Im 6' 1 and only 145.
On a Buzzfeed video where super hams try on 3XL close (or size 22) , Tess tries on the skirts and they don't fit. She even says that is should cover her "FUPA". Reads FPH much?She looks at the size of the skirt and it says 28. They she has the gull to say "it says 28, but I'm supposed to be 22". NO, YOU FAT SACK OF SHIT. You can't manipulate facts to your pleasing. NO, can't just say shit and it's real.
Biting solves all my problems!
How is this much misinformation possible with the internet at one's fingertips? &gt;"I've been drinking Bulletproof coffee with all my meals. Have you heard about it? It's supposed to melt your fat off." Fucking keto. It's giving fatties the wrong idea.
Suit pants and most tailored slacks, are cut to be worn at your actual waist (for men). Jeans, and gym cloth are worn on your hips.
Green is awesome. I can't believe that the blue whale (hah) went back and forth with "N-Nuh uh.. your facts are wrong!! Genetics" etc etcThey're like a broken record.
I want this.
I thought fat girls preferred fit/athletic guys? He's punching above his weight there!
shes 224lbs give or take 10, same height as me at 5'7. disgusting. And im pretty sure she has PCOS or something as i've never seen a woman with such a hairy face, which she only makes more obvious by covering it in foundation
They want a skinny guy, but they don't want to weigh more than the guy. So the guy would need to be like 6'3" to weigh more and still be fit.
I'd ride that party bus!
Hey, don't drag sandals and flip-flops into this.
This... is no bueno. How many of these 7 to10 day long colds have you had? If more than like 3 in a year you should seriously go to the doctors and get a blood test.
Wasn't there someone a while back who did a TV show about how they could only eat cheesy potatoes?
Cuntsack ewww
It's so cash, bro.
I feel bad for any dress or clothing shop that has to cater for these fat bitches. You are fat don't break the human sized clothing.
Well duh, shitlord. Fat womyns deserve hot partners!
America is like giant Britain
That's yoga?!? Maybe me tying my running shoes on before my daily 4 mile run is yoga. It must be hard going through life being fat AND stupid.
People like you and the elderly should be the only reason those chairs exist.

There's "manspreading" i.e gently spreading your legs to make place for your genitals and FUCKING MANSPREADING where you spread your legs so much I would think your testicles are made of crystal.
Well, Danish the pastry is called Wienerbrød in Denmark. That you can eat, but it's really unhealthy.If you want to eat the Danish people, I guess you can do that...
&gt;Her husband is an alcoholic (no one else in my family drinks)I would start drinking too if I had so disgusting obeast for wife.&gt; She brought along her own jar of mayo and lays that shit a quarter inch thickIs this a good moment to say that after reading stories on fph I stopped to use mayonnaise almost AT ALL? Not that I used it a lot before (certainly not like your cousin), but now I am just not able to to stand it. I only add a spoon to a salad or something.&gt;The husband made noise and got in my face saying that they were leaving now and I shouldn't have such a shitty toilet.But of course it was an ophreshun that you didn't have a plus sized... excuse me... GODDESS sized toilet at home. How can decently sized person be forced to take a shit on a puny toilet? You should have been prepared, of course.
Somebody push it back into the ocean!
She's 8 inches shorter than me and thirty five pounds heavier -_-Also your BMI is 24.4, you're getting dangerously close to fat. I'd watch it.
Used my real IG account, some hamplanets follow me, this should be fun
That'll do it.
500 cheeseburgers for $500? Something, something Doctor Who marathon.

Yeah I know people had good reasons for not liking the video but it's possible to come up with solid reasons for disliking any kind of art, really, just depends on who's willing to do it and how many do it. And even if this video deserved to be taken down it doesn't mean the next video people protest will be. I'm just worried that if MDE are taking suggestions they will constantly have people (probably usually a vocal minority) telling them to remove their newest video and we'll end up losing a lot of good stuff with the bad stuff.
We will have to special order them.
Or the Blob.
I'm not sure why you feel the need to say that. I think it's pretty normal to be attractive when you're healthy. Saying that she'd be pretty if she was a healthy weight is basically like saying she'd be pretty if she looked completely different. Kind of meaningless.
Well I am actually vegetarian and workout frequently. I got into a fight with her about my diet and she stormed off. Later I saw her rage filled facebook post about it haha. I've been a long time lurker here so I decided I would post. I don't think you can tell me about whats healthy or not...
Don't compare uncooked sausage to that disgusting blob. Uncooked sausage looks nowhere near that bad.
What ever you say that is one well built wheel chair.
I can smell the beta from here, and also pork chops.
some people are just fucked up. You're a healthy weight, that is the important part.
Haha I thought it was her too. I thought it couldn't get worse, but woof!
yeah the whole fuckin thing
What the hell. She has to have ballooned in the past 2 years.
Actually, the first hamplanet fights the second planet as well as the thin girl, even though planet 2 was trying to take planet 1's side. Planet 1 wants to be the one to whoop dat thin girl's ass, and she attacks planet 2 as well when she gets in the way. At one point she throws them BOTH across the room.
I've used LSD quite a bit. I just turned 18 and I haven't noticed anything different besides my anxiety is almost non-existent.
Love how she's so proud of her body but always poses in positions that flatter her? Like, post a full length mirror shot you pussy hypocrite.
If they hit on all the regular people expecting to get laid, I'd say that qualifies as drunk, cut them off.
Why do these people not understand that they ARE their bodies. They always talk as if their body is something outside of them that they don't have control over.
Oh, my god. This just explained my mother a bit. The whole, "screaming-shrieking-sobbing" at dad because her coworkers didn't like her. Now, she's also mental a bit (standard Narc + Borderline Personality), but she was much fatter than she is now when she went to work at a bank. She only lasted a month and every single day she worked she came home to cry (like, we had to seal all the windows because we were worried our neighbours would call the police, kinda crying) to my dad that everyone at work hated her.She would get upset that her coworkers said "hi" to her. She'd cry that they were picking on her when one of her coworkers made a genuine effort to try to get to know her - she thought the woman (a nice old woman who was like a grandma) was trying to get under her skin instead of actually just wanting to hold conversation.She's lost weight since then and her last job lasted about 4 months. She didn't have any of her other freak outs, just her narcissistic paranoia. Wow, that's crazy. It makes much more sense, now. Hopefully I can get her to lose a bit more weight - maybe it'll fix her a tad bit more.
To be fair, it looks like youre buying a scooter too
It should feel violated! We all do!
that pic is extremely safe for life.
The "I just snapped my ankles from those pointe shoes" look.
I am firmly of the opinion that it is the woman's choice. I'm sorry he wanted to be a dad and didn't get to, but it is her body. She should not have to have a child if she does not want to, end of discussion to me. Also, Pro-choice =/= pro-abortion.
Hams ate everything seen
Nuts and peanut butter help a lot. They only issue is that some are more oily than I'm used to eating (nuts don't always have many oils, but there's usually enough that if I eat some they upset my stomach). I just need to get over the hump and get used to it.
That's true - and as a CIS, white male I'm willing to claim I was oppressing that poor, female Asian if it helps get her page back online...or she could just claim gluttony is a sin and say she's simply practicing Christianity - either way.
I posted a shitlordy thing on Yik Yak and it promptly got five downvotes and automatically deleted.
Indeed, which is why there are so many fatties in third world countries.
Best answer
I'll bet she doesn't count the dressing she drowns them in
Why do they always think they're not "allowed" to do sport? NO ONE CARES! No one will stop you. It's just easier to pretend you're being shamed out of doing activities than it is to put your shoes on and actually do it!
Fuck off with that fat sympathy.Banned.
So much sense made in this post. Bravo shitlord great explanation
Hail Zyzz, but I don't see how this belongs here.
Awww man i really wanted to watch this video; but sadly, it won't play on my phone (iPhone 5). Anyone have a link that will work on phones?
They'd only end up owing money.
You'd be a sour bitch too if you had nothing to like about your appearance and it was physically painful just to breathe/stand up/etc.
True. They talk about others shaming them but the amount of shame I would feel just looking in the mirror would be far worse than what others could do if I was one of them.

Just imagine how many fatties you could offend with this shirt, their death glares would be so satisfying.
They figure, "nothing ventured nothing gained" I actually had a young (Grannyshitlord is Strictly Non-Cougar) Tweedledum at my second job ASK me for sex for a Christmas present.

Wouldn't the good hearted people have friends and family who would gladly help them in most cases? I bet the majority are cunts and have burned all their bridges.
Right? She thinks because she toasts it and it looks thinner that's its low calorie. IIRC bagels are about as caloric as any bread by volume.

/r/HailCorporate this body built by Chik-Fil-A.
He could seriously just buy a treadmill or stationary bike and weights, and work out from home. I'm sure he isn't playing 20 hours a day. Just maintaining diet with minimal exercise would drop the weight like mad. Then he could stop complaining about his back and knee injuries.
Senpai will ignore its gravitational pull ~~

My whole family is very fat. BMI of 35+, easily. I only had hope for my brother, who used to be very chubby. After years of us clashing, his spirit animal is Johnny Bravo and I couldn't be prouder. :')

This is damn depressing.
I just watched this episode due to this pic. The difference between this fat chick and the fat black guy logic is on opposite sides of the spectrum. The black guy admits is him who keeps himself fat, while the girl blamed everything but her fat self. It was amazing to watch. Plus, now I want that cookie from whole foods.
He should probably wash that hand.
Don't forget all that Ranch dressing that will be poured on or dipped into. As an American, when the fuck did Ranch dressing become the go-to condiment? I hate that stuff. Tastes like loneliness and self hate to me. Blergh. Also, where in the fuck does one order a pizza of that immensity???
I mean its an incredible business idea. They drop like flies, and you can charge double for a specialty product.
&gt; now careful not to drop ya'lls genetiks kids. We just spent 30 bucks on that handful of body trash which could have easily bought us a weeks worth of produce and fruits
When your fat eats around your facial features so much that no one knows what you actually look like any more. When you qualify as a wart hog riding a horse. When other women have waist measurements smaller than the circumference of your upper arm. When you sitting on an animal counts as animal abuse.That's when you're beyond all fucking hope.
Lol. Me too man, me too. I'd probably have to do some actual work. Fuck.

Its in the realm of the living dead now.
There are a lot of deaths due to septic shock when dealing with the morbidly obese. They can't wipe, so it festers. Urine and feces are acidic, and eventually eat away the skin and get into the bloodstream. Once you've got all that nasty bacteria and whatnot in your bloodstream, you die.
Congrats, now back to the grind! :D
Hey there! I frequent /r/theredpill. Would you mind elaborating as to how you think they promote unjust treatment of women? Not looking to troll or an endless debate, just curious. I.e. exactly what behaviour do they promote that's immoral?
Is he like this is real life?
1977 is the year the U.S. officially adopted low-fat dietary recommendations. Fat is somewhat effective at sating hunger, while the sugar and carbs that replaced fat in the new low-fat foods did not, and has the additional effect of causing blood sugar spikes and crashes, which is both an addictive pattern and does widespread damage to the metabolic system, causing diabetes.
Nope, you are squatting far above your body weight. For her to match your power to weight ratio she would need to strap one of her 250 pound followers to her back first.
I just did the same thing, threw up a bit in my mouth. Ugh.

Wait, let me guess; he also always complains about being, "stuck in 'the friend zone'" and "girls only date douchebags who treat them like shit" right?

Not true. Head of the NAAFA was a guy, until he [died at 46](URLThey try and say it wasn't fat related: pneumonia. But diagnosis and treatment of it is complicated by fatassness.
No. He had a spouse and children. George Takei is gay, but I do not think anyone else from the show is. That might be wrong, but Leonard Nimoy definitely had a spouse and children.
Taco bell is just one of those things you have to really be craving, even when stoned. Waffle House though...I could live off of waffle house if the negative health effects weren't there.

Regardless of weight, being a woman and / or choosing to have kids doesn't entitle you to special privileges. Something, something, equality.
Well, I don't pander to my weaknesses. I hope to overcome them. I don't think eating junk is perfectly healthy, but I instead view it as an addiction I need to overcome.I grew up eating crap food, and my parents never ate at home. They'd go to places like Red Lobster, Chili's, and Olive Garden. I could eat whatever I wanted, and I would suck down sodas to the point that the waitress would bring me a fucking pitcher for myself. My parents never told me no in regards to food. My mom was also terrified of me leaving the house, because she thought I'd get kidnapped or something. So she bought me whatever video game system I want and I'd log 5-6 hours a day sitting in front of the TV playing games.I don't think any of that shit gives me an excuse to eat bad food now. I'm an adult now and even though I'm 325 pounds at 6ft even (I was 365 at my heaviest), I spend every day concentrating on improving who I am as a human. Not "lurnin to assept mah kurves." I'm ashamed of my size, and I should be. Because my size could injure the back of EMT workers, my size is partially to blame for why healthcare is so fucked up, and my size keeps me from being able to be the real me that I see in my head.I have NO sympathy for anyone who's OK being fat.I know it's difficult to quit eating some of these foods, it's been more difficult for me than it was to quit smoking. I know I have a food addiction. But just giving up and deluding myself to think my problem is OK is no better then a drug addict doing the same fucking thing.That's my take on it anyway.
TL;DR Hot people do what they want.
Hm I guess your second line threw me off.
I sometimes eat cheese by the half or full pound, but I look much sexier doing it (granted, still not a sexy sight).
Nah, you're fine, enjoy your last weeks of pant weather :)I wear skirts/dressy shorts year round, with tights but still, skirts at least twice a week unless it snows or something. I don't know if that's European thing or not.
&gt; YOU CAN BE FAT AND BE ANOREXICNo, you can't. If you have disordered eating habits while not underweight then you'd be diagnosed with EDNOS. One of the criteria for anorexia nervosa is maintaining a body weight below 85% of that expected. [Here's] (URL
There is one that had a pretty amusing string of pictures. And FatYoga brings up a bunch of sad poses. As someone that is deep into yoga, I don't know if I could stomach it. There's not even any form.
I agree in principle but the reality is sadly not the case. Yep the Dad's are shitty as well. But even the good ones often lose the custody battles.Time and time again I see it. It start's with the Mother going fat - the family falls apart from there. Either with the Dad caving in and going fat too or the Dad leaving or in the process of leaving - where the kids end up with Mum regardless. I guess blame the inequality of the law for that?
Really? That's the excuse they're going with now? SMH
Well now that she tore a hammy (lol) she has an excuse to get fatter.
They need to understand: If you have a fatass, look like a fatass, and sound like one, then you are a fatass. They need to stop letting their emotions take control of their lives; you don't get anywhere by whining and screeching like pigs.
I, for one, very much enjoy looking at elephants and baboons.They are certainly more preferable to look at than those fat fucks.
I'm British and... you're right.
Not Tibetan per se, they're devas/wisom kings/myo-oh that appear in all Buddhist branches. Tattoos of them are not a huge (pun) deal; yakuza and even modern normal Japanese people get them all the time. And keeping their image/name secret sounds like hippie cult madness... And yet, see my other comment...Fudoh/Acala is cool and all, but he is **"the Unmoving"**...
Good for protein world
Apparently my vagina and I have to have a conversation about our place in the universe. I say we're real. Fatties are trying to convince us otherwise.

&gt;solely because your partner gained weightNo. This simply doesn't exist. No one just gains weight. They become too weak to say no to food. They become too lazy to work out. And then they become too selfish to see themselves from their partner's perspective. If you were healthy, conscientious, caring person when we met, and you become weak, lazy, and selfish, I'm out. Even if you don't gain any weight.
Fat people will never take responsibility for making themselves disgusting. So they cling to things like HAES, set points, and thyroid disorders.
That's because her ONLY target demographic is fat bitches.

Thank you so much for what you do! Off topic, but I just love the RD assigned to me in the hospital and she's the only one other than my GI in my doc team who doesn't give me shit for being a vegan and I'm on a soft foods type diet now that I hate and she always brings in new ideas and recepies for new stuff to eat that won't wreck everything and help w/ the nausea and shit (literally)You guys are truly awesome and help a LOT w/ hospital stays that are pretty shitty otherwise, just wanted to say that, good luck on your dissertation :3And fuck non-compliant pieces of shit, they're asking to die, imo, there's literally NO REASON a young person should be on bed side dialysis unless they were BORN w/ a genetic renal condition, I mean, wtf
You'll never get anywhere with that mentality. I worked my ass off at every job I've had and it has paid off. Management notices things like that

I get the idea that sleeping with the woman on the right would make me acutely aware of what it's like to be a male black widow during mating season.
I related a story a while back about a kid in the corps who was 210 , 5'10", 38 inch waist and a 15 inch neck.He literally had a thin neck and carried all his weight in his gut. He looked like a 200 lb sack of chewed and shitted bubble gum.
he needs a cut and a wash, that shit is so greasy you can wring it out and lubricate an engine with it

&gt;Extra cheeseI fucking hate extra cheese it just makes the entire thing have zero taste and makes you feel sick anyway.&gt;bbq sauce extra sausage and four slices of white toast &gt;coke zero&gt;coke zero after already fucking your breakfast upIm so triggered by fat food choice
Fatkini, shitty tattoos, SJW Neon Hair, Problem glasses.... God, this is a Femnazi, isn't it?
The fact you can see her nasty greasy pigtails represented here stands out to me. Gross upon gross.
No way man, in no universe is that David Bowie's wife
No actually. It really is quite arbitrary. You have hourglass, apple and pear.
Time to start hoarding tape measures before vanity sized standards roll out. Or tape measures printed on stretchy fabric.
Does she honestly think that indoor skydiving places hate money that much? Sister, if they refuse to serve you, maybe there's a good reason for it.
That triple chin.
This is why I've just decided to hate fat people because a lot of them don't care about what they have done to their body. Atleast every now and then, I meet someone who has wised up and decided to change.
hahaha, "too many cats". get out of here with that shit. No such thing as TOO many cats for Tumblristas.
Now I'm imagining how the fat guy's thumb looks. @_@
YOU! I LIKE YOU! I replay every July. Can't wait.
Her weight has gone back and forth. She got thin at one point though.
Not gnarpump?
That's 660 lbs for two people.
&gt; you have internalized misogynyI love when SJW's tell me what I'm *really* thinking, deep down inside, even when they don't know me. It helps me because I know I don't have to talk to them. After all, why bother if their minds are already made up to the point they think they can peer into the thoughts of strangers? :3
Yes
I put up with this once, never again. Next time I'll have no problem asking for a newseat, where I can have the whole one.
The term BBW really pisses me off. Yeah, you're big, but not even close to being beautiful. Get fucking real.
Yeah I always use a /s on this sub. A lot of people here can't read sarcasm from text. I never have a problem, but I dont wanna get banned.
And soon enough suffer vitamins/minerals deficiency.
And yet, if you love the body you carve out in the gym or are just thin, you're a fucking fatshaming, thin-privledged shitlording, oppressive asshole.Hypocrisy at it's finest.
I have to respectfully disagree.Scientist: a person who is trained in a science and whose job involves doing scientific research or solving scientific problemsMedicine is absolutely a science. Diseases and physical disorders are scientific problems. Every time a doctor records treatment on a patient he/she contributes to the body of medical research. Medical doctors are scientists.

She does look old.
Difficult, yes but not impossible to make fantastic meals from a scooter. My grandma, who physically can't walk and can only use her left hand, can still make the best fucking food I've ever had.
For someone like me who like tiny living space, this is dream home.
"Chunky" doesn't even sound better than "fat"! In fact, I think it sounds even more gross.
Lol. Came here for a "Twist : actually 30 y.o."
I missed spelled "Prison", actually.
Completely agree with you Krog. I don't really appreciate someone using our shared hatred of fats as a cover to feed us a very biased and divisive rhetoric. I hate fats. I also hate (most) feminists. I usually only show one of those two when I'm in this sub because it just isn't the proper platform.
The comic doesn't say anything about fat people. Its talking about ugly people.When you apply this comic to hams, it's basically just thin privilege bullshit with a side order of "I'm fat but I have such a great personality..."
We went wrong when we allowed conglomerates to make food like products for consumption, we allowed "the bigger is better" mentality to seep into marketing and advertising. Like it or not, fat logic came when people were told en mass that "they needed to have more". Super-size that? Yeah, because for $.39 more you can get double the food. What a value!! (I am not saying its all "their" fault. But I can't help but think that if we still ate the way we did earlier in the day, we wouldn't have all these huge behemoths running around and taking up space. We never adjusted our food intake along with the decreased labor and activity levels that came with the rise of technology.
No, I'm saying at 170 I started noticing how much better I felt. I'm around 150 now. Also, to be fair, I am carrying an above average amount of muscle, enough to give me at least a couple of points on the BMI. Again, not trying to say I wasn't fat, or obese.
So if a thin person was in press tent at a music festival and managed to fall out of their chair, knock over a table and all their food they wouldn't be humiliated? I know just because your obesity grants your extra gravity doesn't mean the whole damn world revolves around you. This chick needs to stop acting like only fat people are ever humiliated.
Wow there, that fish is still cuter than the creature in the picture. Let's not insult even more of our aquatic life by comparing it to these obeasts.
I call may self king!
Oh wait 5 mins? Sweet! fresh fries! what a hambeast piece of shit. I hope she chokes.
Amazing how this didn't show up in any science news feeds...
its 31 over a 32 people are fat now
It will end with tears in a car or thunderous rounds of applause from the restaurant.
Ham has less fat
The YouTube comments are actually disgusting, I had to stop reading after the third one said something along the lines of being glad she attacked the cat for some bullshit reason.
I will third that sentiment. Super hot.
All I am saying is that I think a lot of people self-diagnose and the pharm companies have no problem telling people what they want to hear.Just because there are "thousand upon thousands" of journal articles, it doesn't necessarily make the experts right. There are over 2 billion Christians in the world that believe in something that cannot be proven to exist. Are they right just because they are in the majority?

People are allowed to have preferences. If a black man doesn't want to date black women, that is literally no one else's business but his own. It's 2015; who the fuck cares if people wanna date outside their race or ethnicity.
I should have guessed. Vegetarian doesn't suit my lifestyle. Not many vegetarian powerlifters. Also, I love meat. There is absolutely no way around going to Walmart.
Yik yak is filled with white knights, its so unbelievable. Its funny how people get so offended on it for being told to shut up when they are spewing crap. Only thing I like about it is that I learned other people around me use this sub and i'm not the only one. Nice to know there are others.
Lazy and inconsiderate. Typical Hambeast.
I interpreted this as her mass affected the sea level. I am not a smart man.
I'm gonna take a swing here: Fatty catfished, got called out on it, rushed home after a light snack to combat starvashun moad, and turned the (probably average-sized) guy into a fatter (notice how she emphasises that) asshole so she could play the victim and be rescued by Ser Fedora the White. "You saw my picture! Why did you even agree to coffee?" Bitch, you ain't the woman in those pictures. Fucks can't even be honest with themselves. Anything typed out with blubberous "fingers" is a fucking lie. THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY REASONS WE HATE YOU.

Yes, enjoy weak abs showing through because your body fat is extremely low. Amazing. Keep making those abs in the kitchen, I guess. *Edit - Essentially we're making the same point, I just think if you want a good looking core you need to work out and eat right.
&gt;Over the past three years, 85 schoolchildren in the region have been admitted to hospital because of their weight, **including seven two-year-old toddlers.**These are fucking children. They have ruined these children's lives for them, and they haven't even had a chance yet. I have a really hard time controlling myself when I see a fat child with fat parents. Do you even realise how much you're damaging them and putting them at risk for obesity-related diseases, such as diabetes? No, of course you don't. Because you *"can't put down the fork."* No, you can put down the fork. And teach your kids healthy habits, so both you *and* your child can live to see them graduate.
That was magical...
Reduced chances of heart disease and diabetes.

She's just an absolute cunt of a woman, constantly ragging people who don't have as much money as her, inflammatory comments about current events, hypocrisy (google the time she ragged someone for giving their kid a 'geographical name' while having a child named India). She deserves a painful death.
I can get into my tiny sports car without parts of me flopping onto the parking break or pushing me away from the door. Oh, and I can get back out of it without grunting and wheezing.
Man, i love me some mayo sandwiches. It's pretty normal to have here in Canada. When i told an American friend of mine i was having one, he Was almost gagging. Just an almost unnoticeable layer of mayo between is pretty good. Kinda like butter on bread. Now, if you're talking about a load of mayo between, that's nasty.
Holy shiiiit... Canada here, these are our stats:* 42% of men are overweight* 27.6% of men are obese* 23.7%of women are overweight* 23.5% of women are obese...gross!

Working out doesn't help me with depression. Physically, I feel and look better. Mentally, it does nothing. Some days I don't have the motivation to get out of bed to take a shower, put clothes on, or have some food and water - much less put in an hour at the gym. Recently I pushed to do a workout despite how low I was feeling. I got the workout done just fine, but then spend half an hour crying in the corner instead of stretching and cooling down. Excercise can do a lot of great things, but it can't cure mental illness.
Once I have this I will never want anything ever again. And if I feel the feeling of desire coming on, I will go stand in my sexy shower until it goes away
This is a trap... this is clearly photoshopped. This is a hidden fatty face swapped onto a skinny girls legs. It's a ploy for a fatty to try to get positive attention. Edit: Wait... I could be wrong... At first glance it looked like her body didn't match up correctly. Upon further investigation here's my discovery.URL
hahahaha
I thought it was a fat guy till I saw the shape of a bra, eww

And not only that! The size 0 that I used to get at Macys feels more like a 4, target would have to make an xxx small.. Women with my body type are no longer the main consumers because women are being encouraged to *embrace* larger versions of themselves.. Ok, so as a whole we eat like crap in the US, got it. But a little.. I don't know; for lack of a better word, encouragement from society to keep it together wouldn't hurt.I'm not saying that everyone should be my size but I mean... A 14! Eat well, do something fun outside.. this is where my fatpeoplehate comes from. I just don't understand.
If someone ever got my kid one of those books id throw it away in front if them. How dare you try to push your ideals a beliefs on MY child. And yes i would do the same thing if someone "gifted" my child religious materials as well.
Yup. When i was in really good shape I would have 3 really good meals every day and then once a week or so i would eat an entire large pizza by myself, or a huge ice cream from Coldstone. You really have to work at it to get this fat.
I was thinking the same thing. Go ahead.
I hope not 0_o
I'm trying to make it catch on.
I comment a lot in this sub and I've even posted a couple things and I've never been banned from them. Haha, the hammy-mod must've been busy rooting around in the fridge whenever I've posted. Lessee if I can skirt that porkass banhammer one more day.
Oh, god. Maybe it's just cheeto dust.
So fucking hilarious. His beer belly probably weighs more than my whole body.
I would probably pay to see the reaction from fatties if shitlordsGW took over their forums.
Jeez, she must have been poured into those shorts.
D: That sounds fucking horrible!
I compliment them on their weight "loss." No matter what, they always say they've been watching what they eat. Once you give them that false compliment, they go to the scale to see their "progress" and find out that they have either a) gained weight or b) lost no weight since their last time waddling onto a scale.
I worked long days in health care but I set a routine and stuck with it. It's hard at first but it's manageable :/
Shopped. Its a dude.
Just going to leave my username here
Exactly, because they play video games all day instead of being active. Why can't people get that?
Haha, I wish I had been meaner to her but I just walked away quickly knowing that she would never be able to catch up to me. If it ever happens again I'll use one of your lines. Best part? I was a teenager at the time, so this grown ass whale actually had the nerve to berate a friggin stranger kid in public... no shame with these folks, I swear.
Because eating a whole pizza shows how strong and determined you are. Everyone knows skinny people are all suffering from anorexia or a different mental disorder.
I'm a woman and the one on the left is better looking. She's athletic. Burn the one on the right
Happy Easter to you as well!I know what you mean about regarding all foodstuff as "sacrifice", God told us to be stewards of the earth which means treating all the living things on the earth with respect. I don't think cows who live knee deep in their own excrement and get stuffed with antibiotics and hormones every day so that we can have cheap mass produced cheeseburgers are being treated with respect. Nor do chickens who live in a tiny cage in a barn with no windows their whole lives so that we can have things like KFC. None of that was a thing until relatively recently. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad we have enough food to feed everyone. I grew up in a country with a massive deficit of food so I never cease to be thankful for the abundance of food here in USA but I think there is actually an *overabundance* of it, at the cost of the welfare of the animals who provide us with this meat. I'm not a vegetarian, I think meat is good, but only if the animals are treated humanely. Chickens should live [like this](URLAnd I actually agree with you about the whole looking your future meat in the eye thing. My husband and I plan to get a few chickens to be used for producing eggs and yes, meat. I'm sure it will be an interesting experience.
Exactly. A normal, thin, white, American male between 25-55 is, I'm fairly certain, the lowest person in that order. Everyone can shit on said demographic, and said demographic must take it good naturedly to attempt to atone for the inherent gifts he's been "given"
The other day I had to explain to my friend what it was like growing up and never climbing a tree. I remember being young and never having the strength to lift my overweight body up. After losing the weight at 18-19, it's pretty incredible to me experiencing things like climbing trees, running, *doing a pull-up* for the first time as a young adult... It makes me sad to have been a fat kid and have missed out on so much. It's pretty depressing to think back on how much I was enabled as a child to be a fatty.And the insecurity is still incredibly true. Honestly, after being so insecure about myself for as long as I was, I don't really think I'll ever be able to get over it. Gaining confidence and starting to get over social anxiety is one of the best things about losing weight (and fuck, there are a LOT of great things about losing weight).
This was so needed in this cesspool of shit
I love it.Me being healthy and in shape is passive shitlording.It's the best kind of win-win.
U havin a giggle m8?
Took me a while to even spot that chair. At first I thought she was levitating.
And that's fucked up because they have probably never been (or down remember being) under 300 pounds and think since they weighed twice that amount, it counts as being skinny. No. You're still horribly obease and there needs to be a 1 in the first number of your weight before you can even began projecting any kind of maintainance.
To be fair, I probably should get around to getting verified at some point soon.
"Hopefully nobody notices me..."Bitch, you're huge with orange hair. Nobody WANTS to notice you, but you keep on truckin' through their fucking line of sight.
Fuck off, fatty.Banned.
factoring the strength of its gravity i must disagree
Hashtag "zombies are real"? Why yes, I would go so far as to say he's right.It wouldn't be too hard to imagine that there's a sub-species wandering this earth, slowly, with decayed, damaged joints. They used to be human, but lost all will and intelligence, and now only possess the basic instinct of hunger. Soulless, broken creatures, who will put themselves and everyone else in danger in the mindless pursuit of warm flesh. That all sounds very familiar.
10 million plus a billion/minus negative a billion. So pretty much a billion plus a million.

Next time someone asks "why are you such an asshole to overweight people?" I'll redirect them to that.
I noticed, although fat women don't picture themselves with uneaten food.
man, i'm out of breath...

&gt; Question for FAT peopleThose *things* are not people.
GED?
Everyone has a tiny amount of fat in their muscles, and some discrete stuff outside too. Fatties just have ridiculous amounts of both.
It would probably have been a modern size 18 or 20. I'd probably be embarrassed to shop at her size too. She could basically only fit into a potato sack and call it a day.
I bet you won't cost nearly as much to keep alive as you age.
Unless the OP's pics show her having sex with multiple partners (unlikely) one cannot determine whether or not she is a slut, ergo, calling her a slut is just an insult. Looking at a fatty and calling them fat is a fact.Hams must be idiots.
Yeah, spamming mod mail will get you shadowbanned.
It blows my mind that I am a 6'0" tall man in pretty good shape and she weighs like 4 times as much as me. 4 adult males.
A full plate of food usually puts a good dent in my appetite, but I do my cheat days right.
"Work on yourselves" You mean like go to the gym or something?
I thought it was so everyone would just die in a few years and we will be left with like 25% of the population we have now.
B and a half, can do.
Yeah I burn about 500 from an hour of running (9-10 minute miles, 6 minute kilometers)
D:
It's hard to believe that 11% of the irish population at most would give a fuck about their bodies within 15 years :(&gt; Obesity was causing about five percent of all deaths worldwide, it said, and costing the global economy $2 trillion (1.8 trillion euros) in healthcare and lost productivity — or 2.8 percent of global GDP.Imagine all humanity could achieve if so much resources weren't wasted feeding mayobeasts and then keeping them alive when they literally fall in pieces from beetus...
This makes me rage.And everyday on reddit you read people that are supposed to be informed with exactly the same rationale.People that do not admit to what they eat or to their levels of activity. People that argue that not all calories are created the same.How did we get here?Where did these myths come from?
Ass pimples, always a bad sign.
I remember visiting Mexico and seeing soda in baby bottles. No bueno.
Agreed. That woman has curves but not rolls of lard all over an Oompa Loompa body.
They were aggressive because they had to do it all by themselves and your comment was pretty stupid. It's a sub with 6000ish users. They weren't expecting a brigade from a default sub because this sub is usually the sub that gets hit.
It has nothing they can take.
Not even close.
No but dissent is you fat fuck.
They don't realize that it is intake vs output. Genetics, condishuns, etc. As long as you have large masses of people that don't accept input / output facts, it will continue.
Same here, when I was a freshman in college. I gained 30 pounds in my first semester, but lost it all and then some in the second. :)

It's hilarious how all the stoners come out to defend their habits in posts like this.No one gives a shit what you do at home. If you blow smoke in the air in a public place with people, I guarantee you that more than one person will notice and at least one of them with be bothered by the smell. Your nose is not as great as you think it is. Whether it's feta cheese or curry or french fries or tobacco or weed, if you consume it often enough, you will get used to its smell and you will not notice it anymore. Or because it's an enjoyable smell to you, you may not notice it as easily. The law of "Don't be a dick!" applies to all. If you think you are an exception and your nose is still super-sensitive, trust me, it's not.

I have a privacy category for fatties on facebook, and I post my workouts/healthy self-prepared food only to them.
&gt;Fracture healing requires more energy than you might expect. Thus, it's appropriate to increase your caloric intake to promote healing. In traumatic fratures of the long bones, for example, there is an immediate increase in metabolic demands that can translate into a caloric demand three times that of normal. While a normally active adult may require 2,500 calories a day, a bedridden, injured patient with multiple fractures may need 6,000 calories per day! If this demand is not met, the healing process is compromised (Kakar and Einhorn, 2004). *Hip fracture patients, Complications and Nutritional demands for Healing*

Her body is profoundly disgusting. Every aspect of it. The shame she's trying to overcome by making that dumb face and flipping the bird is accurate; it's what she *should* be feeling.
150 pounds.I work with kilograms, but I don't think she weighs 150 pounds. Am I wrong?
Ugh, pandering to the fat fuck masses I guess. Can't really blame the companies.
I think now more then ever, we need to fat shame and shitlord all this nonsense into oblivion. Cannot let this bullshit mentality fester. I get really, really heated when they bring children into it - going to "teach them body positivity/acceptance". Its child abuse in my eyes.

In my case having some long terms health issues has "advantages" : I do yearly full physicals including all the classic blood tests.So I like it when someone gives me shit for liking chocolate, or pizza, or fast food... Because I can do better than the obeast who go "but my blood pressure is normal!". I can go into 5 pages of stuff that are normal with me (and wouldn't be if I did not pay attention).Other active male privilege : fast food portions are not incredibly bad (in calories) given my diet. Just don't drown stuff in ranch, swap the soda for water (or zero calorie version) and it's just an "average meal" (with high sodium, and too many calories per protein, but not something I'll need to work off over the week).&gt;In the end, I find if I'm not doing any sports, I'll eat 2500 calories "regularly" or cleanly, and then the 1000 in essentially whatever I want. With sports, it gets a little more ridiculous. After writing it out, sounds exactly what you propose on doing lol.I'm not looking to cut my body fat % too low anyway (15-20% seems right to me) because I feel like it's a good reserve if I have health issues later on. So as long as I get enough protein to get my muscle mass where I get the performance I want (to me it's about doing martial arts and be able to feel I give 100% even in the longer training sessions, nothing competitive), I won't care about "bulking" or "cutting". For the people who want to build more and more muscle mass, it would be heresy I guess.
Maybe it's tight because no one will go the fuck near it.

You can probably still park in there AND box the fatty in. Win-win.
I've never understood why they think that massive fat deposits = strength. Attention fatties you probably have less muscle on your grotesque frame at 250 than I do at 140. Your lard isn't good for anything besides deep fat frying

"Or I will eat you" I fear this is meant to be serious.
I'm about to go to a vegan place for lunch (because they have the best fries and I'm celebrating my first non-mush food after wisdom teeth removal). I plugged in estimated calories for their tofu wrap and an order of fries--about 900 calories. There's nothing inherently healthier about vegan food.
Why the hell is this Charlie beast recommending that people put hair removal cream around their assholes? That shit is NOT meant to be applied to that type of skin!

Not sure why these people saying it's a troll account are being downvoted right now...It is a troll account.Follow any Youtube video linked on Reddit that's popular and you will see a bunch of troll accounts having the top comments.

You should probably show her a picture of her old self. Maybe that will trigger her back.
They should literally rename "huffington post" to "we saw it on reddit"
The title of the article calls her a model. She fits the definition because she is a representation of/representing something, but most people think beautiful when they think model, which she is not.

Shit, in my city (if you go to the poorer communities) you can buy food stamps for about $0.50 on the dollar from people who would rather have cash for drugs instead of food.
Holy cow, I didn't think it was actually possible to visit here and gain weight, unless you were super skinny and athletic to begin with. The sheer amount of shit you'd have to eat to make up for western style pizzas and fried mexican food and shit is just phenomenal. You'd have to eat like ramen and at those "big fried rice bowl" places that only drunk salarymen go to like three times a day, and still do things like take cabs to travel 1km.Even the fattest visitor-friends I know end up eating as much delicious food as they want, and always losing weight (whether they're here for 3 days or 3 weeks) from all the daily walking they do here but not back home...

But you mean, sympathy for fat people. Not just fat sympathy. It's one thing to not allow sympathy for people complaining about a situation that they brought on themselves. But It's kind of messed up to encourage not having sympathy toward a logical human being who legitimately is trying to change. Then you're the problem. You're actually encouraging people to be fat by shutting out any discussion of remedying their situation. Is that what you want? More fat people?
Medical student, on fat people hate, with face pics on her profile...Are you trying to get expelled / fired?
Why?
Oh but she's full of idiosyncrasies! The whole thing about guys with shit jobs after saying she works retail really got me. No offence to retail workers, you do a noble job and I wish I had the patience you guys do... but it's not exactly a unique/'different' job is it?And most uni guys work retail because they're at uni working towards a career. Give them 5 years and they'll have a job that might interest you more...
How in the hell do people like this get dressed like that look in the mirror and think ".....yeah this is definitely how I want to be seen in public today" I'm feeling more and more like the European stereotype of women getting dressed up to go grocery shopping.
Don't do that :(You would lose those beautiful breast essentially... 23.5% should be your goal. Not 20%.
I agree to an extent. Female comedians that are really good are few and far compared to their male counterparts, but as many have already pointed out, there are some really worthy of watching. Personally, I loved Joan Rivers. I grew up watching her and appreciate her insult style.
The smile on that thing's face says everything you need to know, food is the greatest joy in its life. Pathetic.
It's as if a "center for bariatric surgery" would want to make their customers feel good about themselves. Imagine that.
There are so many ppl that think they can eat as this fake nattys and then just end up getting fat

Yeah, this trend of referring to hams as people is getting on my nerves.

Sigh.You know him and Hugh Jackman are banging so many side bitches.
Yea same. It used to be expected that women would grow out after high school and now, unless they were already fat, all of them seem to be getting into fitness while the guys just slack off and balloon up.

what a waste. she would be hot if she lost 50 pounds... hmm make that 70 pounds
No, she won't even care, shes OK with that. We've established this woman really does not give a shit.Certainly puts her image and her children online to send a message, a ignorant message at that. There is nothing to do but hope this kids grow up to be better people.

Are you really this naive?Seriously all you just did was make bullshit excuses and contradict yourself. Some people did hate their first ciggy, most don't. You also fail to realize that people who would hate their first ciggy might love that headrush that comes with it, thus doing it again for that feeling (like all drugs and is usually the reason why people start smoking). Getting fat takes years of having a poor diet. You're telling me that if nutrition facts aren't taped to your face, you can't tell if something is healthy or not? Get the fuck out of here kid, you know damn well what is healthy and what isn't, you just CHOSE to keep eating unhealthy. Its not this oops I ate something and now I'm fat, it takes time for you to gain all that mass.Both are absolutely a choice, its just one takes takes more effort to become.

Sounds more like inhaling to me.
What these hams dont understand is that shit like /r/fatpeoplehate NEEDS to exist. If nobody makes you feel embarrassed, or nobody makes you uncomfortable, youre just going to be fine with being fat. If i had bad breath and nobody said anything to me, i would keep having bad breath.

A lot of "body positivity" SJWs are normal weight women. This is what make shit lording out side this sub so hard. They are always gonna argue how their 600 pound friends are just as if not more healthy than they are. However, due to the recent open acceptance of fatties in mainstream society, the fatties have gotten arrogant and start openly body shaming normal weight people. If this girl is lurking right now, I advice her to be cautious of what she wish for. America is already 2/3 overweight and soon you will be the minority and the very same people you try to defend will start bullying you.
All of my upvotes, you can have them!
I'm soooo with you! I live in a fairly affluent, mostly Asian community (I'm white). As we all know, the Asians are the best and biggest shitlords of all!

For sure in cases of extremely underweight people it's unhealthy but I see these hambeasts go off on healthy thin girls calling them anorexic or telling them to go eat all the time. At least all the eating disorder communities that I had been a part most people had a sense of understanding that they were ill, felt a little sense of responsibility, and didn't go parading their disorder claiming to be healthy.
I'm not short everywhere, and I try very hard to please. I'd say my personality is amazing, but it's an acquired taste like drinking neat bourbon or scotch. The physique is always a work in progress.

I'm pretty sure that plucking her eyebrows would make this ham gasp, wheeze, and sweat; then, she would clearly worry about the possibility of lifting those tweezers (and her bulbous arms) burning too many calories and sending her into the dreaded "starvation mode."That is my explanation for why she would cake on so much makeup, but not bother to hedge those woolly caterpillar brows. We got a case of Lipstick-On-A-Pig Syndrome, guys.

145 at 4'8" gives a BMI of 32.6. Or 35.5 by [the formula that probably better compensates for height.](URLYuck.
I see your point, I just feel like the ones who are trying to get healthier (or not doing the opposite) deserve some credit.It would be like calling an obese person at the gym fat, even though they're obviously trying to help. I just hate the "healthy at every size" twats
Oh no doubt. I literally saw a post that said being fat doesn't cause diabetes. They'll believe anything apart from actual facts.

Every time I see a picture of her, I imagine that she'd be really sweaty to the touch. Covered in sweat and a light layer of dust from not showering throughout the day. Almost kinda sticky.
It would be way less embarrassing to ask how to lose weight until the other embarrassing question is no longer necessary. Also, gross.
This might be an unpopular opinion but I've noticed that "geeks" will attach themselves to the first person who'll have them and never leave despite how awful the relationship is.
Normally when people realize that they don't have good facial features, they will try to get in shape to maximize their physical attractiveness so that they don't end up forever alone and cry about how nobody wants them. Instead, an obeast will make dumb faces in front of a mirror for the whole internet to laugh at.
There's a lot of potential money in being freakishly fat, apparently.
I swear to god every single obeast picture on this sub could also be posted to r/awfuleyebrows.
it can be unhealthy if you are starving yourself. I still get my period, my bloodwork is fine. idk i may have health problems in the long run if I stay at this weight but ive tried to gain weight only to gain like 5 pounds and I just lose it again within a week or two

Health care costs are a good point to throw in, you can't really argue that hamplanets are healthy when the government is flushing money down the drain just for them. There are a lot of X-rays of fat people posted here that show the strain their joints are under all the time as well as their size related to their skeleton. Other than that I'd check some credible medical sites for the effects of obesity on the human body.
Is this a normal thing? Can you order something to your specifications, get it served to you and then say (actually say out loud to the staff) "I don't like it"I thought you were just supposed to suffer with your shut decision. I thought you'd only complain if there was an actual problem with your order ie something wrong or missing etcGuess this is fat-privilege.

Devout Muslims actually know hunger from Ramadan. Not eating *anything* for a whole day? Especially after gorging yourself on food the night before, so your stomach is extended and "more empty" than a small stomach? That's a lesson the average ham never knows. Though, admittedly, it doesn't stop devout Muslims from being fat shits, too.

Asian people are incredibly blunt. My mom's friend gained a bit of weight so my mom said to her in Chinese, "You've gotten fat." Her friend took the comment as "Oh shit, I am. I have to do something about it." One of my (former) friends said she wanted to lose weight. I agreed that she could lose a few pounds and that I'd help her. She threw a hissy fit. Whatever.
Her narcissism aside. Snow White was 15. Snow White simply wasn't fat, so why would they hire a fat old cow to play Snow White when there's a 20 something year old who looks her? So much self entitlement.

Wait, are you really defending fat people, is it because you yourself are fat? I wouldn't put it past a fat to pick a food as their name, then misspell it (it's tortilla bruh.) I mean I'm kind of sure that is a bannable offence here.and I think my quoting of I have no mouth does affect you tortia2.It hurts you on a deep and personal level, right in the same place where you keep the delusion that cows are people too, because it made you regurgitate the most bland and boring retort you could.I don't know you, and I don't want to.

That looks painful stuffing all that fat in. I'm almost impressed.
I might be wrong but I read somewhere that it's because they have a whole lot of visceral fat (fat surrounding the organs) so it's actually pushing what muscle there is outwards. So it feels hard, but underneath that is a gigantic thick layer of fat between the muscle and organ. It's the most dangerous type of fat there is.
University student, can't spell. Par for the course these days I suppose.
You are not. Your standards are always wrong, even if you comply to their requirements for your standards. I mean, take these paraphrased requirements I've seen coming from the same source (TiTP):* "Love me for who I am" (Translation: "Love me for my personality.")* "Love me for being a real woman" (Translation: "Love me for my body.")* "You are a misogynist if you love me for my body" (Translation: "Don't love me for my body.")* "You are a misogynist if you don't love my body" (Translation: "Love my body.")See the issue?This is why your standards are always wrong and why you are not allowed to have standards.
29 total body inches shorter... yeah, maybe her height went down that much, after her joints &amp; spine have been collapsing from all that weight over the years.
There are many reasons stopping people losing weight. Its anyone who is GAINING weight you should hate. Losing weight can be put off for a while while you take care of your kids and get a schedual to work around. Keeping yourself from gaining weight is an effort when you're at home alone all the time. But gaining weight isn't on. Its so easily controlled and you really are (not you specifically op) a fat piece of shit if you can't even stop yourself gaining weight while you don't have time to lose it.
Prader Willi Syndrome just makes people feel extremely hungry. They become very overweight because of their ravenous appetites.I would argue people with Prader Willi should be left alone though, because a lot of them are developmentally retarded and have mental disabilities. It's basically impossible for them to manage their weight alone and it can be very difficult for caretakers to deal with them. I watched a documentary on people with the disease that live in a facility just for people with PWS and it's really sad. The sufferers have the cognitive and emotional maturity of a child, so it is very hard to reason with them. They don't grasp that overeating is bad or they do but since they aren't very mature they overeat anyway because like a child they want to have it their way.Even then I remember some of them being normal weight so it is doable for them to be healthy, it's just very difficult to keep them there. That and the disease is super rare, and probably only accounts for a tiny portion of the nearly 70% of Americans with weight problems.

Aww poor baby. We don't even have to try to get rid of you, you're all killing yourselves slowly anyway.
The bacteria in your intestines fluctuate with your diet. If your are missing/low on a particular nutrient then the bacteria that are best at digesting it drop in number. When this nutrient is something like fibre (or some proteins) that humans cannot produce the enzymes to break down, then we rely on these bacteria to do it for us. When you suddenly increase the amount of that nutrient, the bacteria in your gut can't break it down fast enough, so it remains as large, undigested chunks which cause blockage, which causes pain.
I thought I remembered reading somewhere that celery took more energy to digest than it gave from eating it. Is this not correct?

I've read that women are capable of being "political lesbians," that is to say that they're bisexual in their attraction, but they choose to be with women and not men.I have no idea if that's true, I read it in an article about the prevalence of obesity in the lesbian community, but it makes sense in a lay-person kind of way.Dudes want to stick their dicks in things. If you're so fat that a dude's cock can't penetrate you, then dudes won't want to fuck you, whereas women have no such problem.

&gt; We can't change our skin color, but we can lose weight. This statement comes up all the time, but, while true, I think it misses the point. The point is: Fat people are not being oppressed. That's all there really is to say.What they are really talking about when they claim oppression is that they realize that they are *de facto* not as free as thin people. Liberty implies both rights and responsibility, so if you abuse your rights they might be taken away from you as an individual because you have shown that you can't use them responsibly. Convicted felons are denied all sorts of rights, first their freedom of movement for some time, and when they get out again, voting, gun-ownership, etc.. The same thing applies to fat people, in a way, but not to their constitutional rights (they have all those,) but to the freedoms that they protect. Fatties have the right to purchase airplane tickets, but they themselves have made it impossible to exercise that right in the same way as thin people can, simply by being too big. No one is stopping them from exercising that right but they themselves. They want to be able to exercise their rights without taking the responsibility that is required. If they need extra service, they should pay for extra service. If we let them win the airplane seat debate, it would logically follow that fat people should get bigger meals at restaurants for the same price, because it takes more food to sate a fat person's hunger. It would follow that fat people should pay the same price for more toilet paper, because they need to take a shit more often. Fat diabetics should get more insulin shots for the same price, because they need more insulin than thin people do. Fat people surgery should cost the same, even if it takes longer than for a thin person. Fat bariatric patients should get 6 nurses to turn and clean them for the same price as a thin person who needs just 1 nurse. I could go on. Fat people should just get more of everything without paying a single extra cent, because otherwise they are being oppressed. Totally not trying to grab special privileges, honest.The "they can change" argument applies when we're talking about whether obese people be made a protected class. Special protection should not be granted to people who are fundamentally responsible for the position they find themselves in and completely capable of digging themselves out of that position. We are not obligated to stoop to their level and grant them special privileges in order to maintain the illusion of *de facto* equality.
I am the same way I could care less if you were fat but you cant just be fat it also has to come with all their bullshit.
That was a tattoo of a gnat when she first got it.
Fuck, just look at him.. you know hes going to jail soon for rape and or child/pony molesting.
I don't want to find out what gets lost in the cushions.
There's a fat fuck in my company, new guy. My buddy asked him, while he was slamming back bags of gummy bears, ding dongs and Dr pepper, what his MOS was. Knowing he's infantry like us. He pathetically answers "11B.." My buddy goes okay... Couple of hours later after he got MORE of that nasty shit from the gut truck my buddy goes up to him again "What's your MOS?" The kid looked like someone kicked his puppy, he was starting to catch on "11B..." So now every time we see him being a butterbeast one of us go up to him and ask him that haha his face is priceless each time
Whats wrong with that, that comment clearly states that she is not pretty but would be if not fat (aka good hair, eyes, symetry, w.e). That is fine by me
Solution : Stop bothering to wait for it. Just leave it in the dust until it gives up and needs to go replenish its sugars.
She has dietary AIDS
I wonder if that female ham is even pregnant...
The thing that surprised me the most about this wasn't her behavior, or the fact her husband helped, it was the fact that she is employed. It's so easy to go on benefits and not have to work a day in your life that i seriously expected her and her husband to be unemployed, and using tax payer money to go see football matches.She is from Manchester though, they'll knick the wheels right off your car as you pass through without even needing you to stop.
Harder as in engaging more muscle groups, in this case core muscles. Core strength and balance is actually my top priority, so even though I want to be doing squats to shape my butt, if I can better my core/balance at the same time I will be all over it. Increasing weight won't do that.
I thought it said "weight limit reached, please consult the nearest zoo".
Ugh, what happened to this place?
Lol you know what, I'm actually 13 :P. Also check sidebar while you're on here. No fat sympathizing...
Wow, what a piece of shit. Doxxing someone because they called you fat and/or ugly? That's *exactly* what a mentally stable person would do.
Ha. I was just there yesterday.
Wtf I thought that was a stomach
I thought at first, this is really stupid marketing...how are you going to sell clothes to fatties making fun of them.Then i realised this photo makes those pants look better than any death fat filling them out possibly could.
Cuddle butter*
This didn't happen. Point blank period.
"I can't have a thigh gap, even though it's obviously uncontrollable and genetic (like muh fatness), so I'm gonna be shitty and insult their condishuns by saying they have loose, flappy pootangs! fatspo!"How fucking pathetic do you really have to be to have a mindset like that?
Feminism by default(etymologically speaking) is advocacy for the female over the male; this is why "Egalitarian" and "Equal" are good words for making a case for being in favor of an equal philosophy and anything starting with "Femin" is not - think if there was a branch of Egalitarianism which sought to do away with 'gender stereotypes' but was called "Misogynism" - would you *ever* sign up, no matter what their pamphlets said? I will *never* be a Feminist - no one in favor of equality should be - because the root of the word of tainted. Again, if you think this is silly, reverse the situation and see if you'd have a problem...if an anti-racist coalition formed under "Whitepeoplearebetterism" it absolutely does not matter what their stated philosophy is, no one with a whit of appreciation for etymology, language, history or humanity would ever join.It is not my responsibility to dream up a new word where one is not needed. Egalitarianism, Humanism, these terms suffice and while one can technically call oneself these other things as well as Feminist, such a definition is ahistoical and ignores the current environment. The advocacy of Feminism is and has been to advocate for women, *including when that advocacy is unfair or biased against men*. It's not that Feminism has been stealthily infiltrated by a few bad apples who hate men or work against their interest, it's that a large portion, perhaps a majority, of people who identify as Feminist look at a situation where a woman benefits *at the expense of a man* as a 'win' regardless of surrounding circumstance. I challenge you to examine where Feminist money goes, where the rallies protest, where the advocacy in politics goes, and I do not see a lot of work for the betterment of humanity. I see a lot of 'let's make sure that women get a bigger slice of the pie' and not a lot of coherent philosophy of equality where we make the overall pie bigger, for everyone.
No fatties!
I'm done lol
Don't forget the sugar pills. And then film the reaction for Terms of Enrampagement.
The fuck do you mean by "*maybe?*"

Learn to install tile. It's 1/10th of the cost of having a professional do it, and you have a vast variety of tile to choose from rather than the cheap rip-off contractors stuff that installers use to make money. As for a tile cutter, you can borrow one from the Home Depot or Lowe's cheap.
I love the pepper spray on the keychain, as if she's constantly fending off rapists

I want to move to Walnut Creek.
How could you reach the point of not being able to fit in through a door and not think you damn need to lose some bloody weight!?!?
YESSSSS. ten times betterEdit: Don't have to strain my eyes with it now, have to go to the gym now since eye muscles aren't getting a work out anymore=0.
This guy, this guy right here gets it.
Spoken from my true heart!! Couldn't have said better myself.Thank you for sharing, it was a relief of all that pent-up anger after viewing a few imgurs too many. (I'm still relatively new to this site, and boy - there's a big scary world out there i was completely unaware of, never availing of social media. Now i'm checking my privileges like mad, there's one for every rib - and they show. Normalcy (sanity) is being relegated to the obscure fringes of the internet, I feel helplessly sorry for the future generations. The spenglerian dystopia of zombie apocalypse is happening right in front of our eyes.)
I'd rather say fat religious.
Yes, its okay. Good girl.
Yeh. It makes her look like an old lady for some reason.Maybe becasue that's how bikini's looked 'back then'. The only time when those bottoms on thin women were common.
It didn't happen to me. I found it on the site mentioned above.
Better yet, most of them list themselves as average. Fuck yo average. I want reasonable size.
&gt; what a disgrace it is for a man to grow oldFTFY
Message the mods then.
My rule of thumb is if you don't cause dry heaving by wearing it, you're probably alright.
Is the dark one holding a sheet cake?
Size zero here. I actually found a pair of size zero pants the other day that were baggy on me... [and I'm not just bones](URL
Thanks, yeah, I've been meaning to give it a try to work on my upper-body strength!
This is the correct response, well done sir.
I can see the outline of where his chin should begin.
He probably resented the hospital food because in my experience they only give you ~2000 kcal a day. Hospital food is decent stuff.
I saw that, and I lol'd. She's weaksauce man. When things get hard, she's going to starve to death.
The difference here is effort. People on the left put it in the gym, while the right put it in their mouths.

At least he made an attempt.

This is what happens to me when I eat raw almonds, almond flour or butter, and bananas. It didn't start until I was in my late 20s.

lol, I was doing research about fat in Japan.
Said no one. Ever.
You must have been. Fat stink settles into discreet layers and you happen to be kneeling in the worst one.
Its not that i need to be bigger its that I need more fat so I have some to lose while bed ridden.
Those pants are at their max stretch capicity.
Why a fedora? A tiny lil hat will not hide all that fat
She's been playing the 'awkward fat girl' part for so many years now, and has made lots of money off it.Time she got some fucking respect for herself and got to a normal size.
Please don't say it causes cancer, tumors, ALS or whatever, the consensus in the scientific community have concluded that those are myths ages ago.
I am... oh you meant like one of those tasty cookies.
Hahaha this is fucking hilarious. Sry I hurt ur feefees
I'm with you. It seems to come as a shock to these people that models get the job *because of how they look*.
Some kid she's saving for later is hanging out of her backpack..
If she won't be "a round" does that mean she'll finally lose weight?
I knew it, a normal person would've recognized the hypocrisy.
He looks like Fat Albert
I like how none of them can actually run, they just waddle awkwardly at a slightly brisk pace.
Yeah, I've seen his Munchies and Vice Eats segments -- he seems pretty chill, but the thing is he blamed his weight gain on breaking his leg (which led him to rapping), stupid, but I digress. Hopefully he won't end up like Big Pun, heart attack at 700 lbs, the fat bastard.
Four tits? Yummy
Had to tell you this had me rolling. Have an up vote.
"Will never be thin" Wouldn't it be funny if lochtess saw that post as was motivated to lose weight? Oh that would a bitter loss to hams. Lol
Ironic considering that beast probably hasn't seen hers in a while.
Really?! My shitlady heart is melting though I avoid their products. (I dunno why I just do.) I just wonder how much extra cash the weight watchers paid to get that slot though. Must be a fight on it's own amongst the advertising companies and PR departments.
That was the perfect response. In any situation that would shut down bullshit immediately. Nice job!
If she actually had Binge Eating Disorder she wouldn't be writing it on a picture of her fat body. A diagnosis of BED under the DSM5 requires that there is a large amount of distress accompanying the eating. A person who is distressed about something does not go and advertise it to the world.
I am a piece of shit. Who likes to make fun of people all the time but this subreddit is really scum-mish.- From a person that is nowhere near fat
How she dares to say the word sexy
And you wouldn't give fat even to a rat.
I don't even know what to think anymore! LOL
Flawed logic, that's how this works. For example, by this logic, micro penis guys are still wonderful sun dials.
Privacy...And why would you post pictures of your niece on facebook? I am curious, too.
Banned for pig fuckery.
It's amazing that the zipper hasn't already exploded.
Yeah, Zara is a good one, and Massimo Dutti is great for fit too. The problem is my style is *definitely* not European Minimalism - it's a mix of London OTT and a bit of New York preppy. If Kate Spade, FCUK and Polo Ralph Lauren fail me, I am truly lost :(
It might just be her shirt.
This is actually an interesting question. If i go somewhere to eat and i request a change in the recipe, and they agree, but then don't deliver, do i have any legal recourse?Some people have food allergies and can even die if the cook puts something in there that it wasnt suposed to...
All I see a doomed children

&gt;writing a book about my life...Bitch that's going to be a fucking pamphlet ! you better loose that weight or you will be dead by 50 :/
I live near Newbury now, so it's not quite as bad as other parts of Boston. Allston is pretty bad. I once saw a land whale walking in the middle of comm ave. (not really crossing, just walking). I was afraid that if I hit her, my jeep might get totaled.
Spot on
Correct. It's pomade, meant to be used with a *very* light hand, and very sparingly to fill the brows.
That's just a phase she's going through. Her true orientation is Golden Corral.
And the fucks I would give after taking the phone and closing the door.
Second pic it looks like her eyebrows are sinking into her head
We can only hope
Dude, can you read my mind? My EXACT thought.
It happens because of hormonal imbalance but the exact reason is largely unknown. If it's not managed it does make it easier to gain weight and could lead to type 2 diabetes. Except that it can be managed by dieting and exercising so it really bothers me when people blame it instead of themselves for their weight-gain.
Why? You have nothing to do with those people. Go out and do something valueable

Oh boy that irritates me when weight is lumped in with all of those other things that are inherent. I was born with a heart defect. *That's* the kind of shit you can't control, idiot. Fookin' bottom feeders.
To be fair, most of the ham beasts he sees probably DO get better. To not lose weight after surgery like gastric bypass or similar is next to impossible, but damn it, some fatties take that as a challenge.
Is there anything more frustrating than a fat ass sitting on a machine at the gym doing nothing making people wait for it?
"The fats should be forced to look down in the presence of people."Just like a ho when addressing her pimp.
Why in the bloody hell are people downvoting you Doc?^ This man has a preference. He married and impregnated a SIZE ZERO. He isn't a fucking degenerate **feeder**, he is ravenously turned on by his FIT, PREGNANT WIFE....not sure how you fit Ds into a size zero, mind, but I'll take the story at face value. I personally prefer petite boobies, but holy HELL people!
this is what makes me more sad than angry. that they put it down before trying it and will never get to experience itwaking up early and driving to a crag. the approach hike where you can see the peaks and you just get fucking pumped while you hike up and eat your snack. unpacking all the gear. deciding who'll go first. that satisfying midday break and the cool down climbs.. fuck. it's so great just makes me sad because the experience is so... not to sound pretentious but... spiritual? I hate that word but it fits. oh well. more for me i guess

I passive aggressively eat healthy things in front of them in my dining hall at college. I don't say anything to them but every once and while they look up and see me smirking at them while i munch on Broccoli.
D:
Watch Fat Head. The guy in the documentary loses weight and gets healthier blood work by eating nothing but McDonalds for like a month (forget the exact time frame). Basically he was saying how Super Size me was bullshit and it's the choices you make that matter, not McDonald's fault.
Whole foods is the devil. I would get fat if I had one close by. So much amazing food. The cheese! Omfg the cheeses. Fresh fish galore and they let you try just about everything. I don't see how anyone could lose weight shopping there.
There's something majorly wrong with you, when not even a MySpace angle can hide your extra chins. Here's hoping she doesn't make it the whole 5 years you're predicting.
How exhausting must it be to have to wear a bunch of different things under your actual piece of clothing just so you don't look like shit...if I want to wear a dress I just...put it on? I don't even know why someone would need shape wear or a bra under a dress (unless you're very well endowed with pretty breasts, not the sad eggplants hams have) to "control your tummy", like...your "tummy" is supposed to be concave or flat.
Are you saying that you aren't an adventurer?
Ban it.
She was rolling downhill.
&gt;bad publicityThis would be enough. Fat is a socially protected status. Just people with sympathy for these poor creatures is enough to override logic in the public consciousness.Maybe this will convince the lurkers who think they need sympathy. Sympathy in this case leads to them getting killed or injured out of their own negligence and costing innocent people shit-tons of money and shame from the public when it's not deserved.
3 pieces is the appetizer.
Me too, Frontega Chicken sandwich all the way!!
There are several subs that use a randomized picture on the sidebar. There are more than enough fucking fatasses to supply us with random pictures of degeneracy for ages.
All fatties have a dietary issue. I don't give a fuck what you do, cycle, lift, run marathons, if you are fat, your diet is fucked up.
Its funny cus when animals get to be fat we kill them. In America we put them on welfare. We should lock them in cages.

What's funniest is that the majority of them DON'T have large tits, just a large chest shelf of lard. The breasts atop that mound of fat are just sad &amp; saggy.
[I got this one for you guys](URL
same thing happened to me, I got into a discussion with a mod about it and it was pretty pathetic, I'll post the convo later if anyone wants a good laugh
Most of that food looks like he took a bunch of rotten food, put it in the garbage disposal, took it out and ate it.
They're probably in the ER because their tired of their general practitioner telling them to lose weight whenever they make an appointment. This way they just get "medicine" for their "condishuns" so they can go out to that restaurant and stack up some beetus.
I didn't know they were as bad as racial SJW in hating on their own kind too! (The idea that a POC who can be mistaken as a white person (white-passing) needs to take a seat because they don't have it as difficult as someone who is clearly POC.) Don't worry Pluto, you might think you're small but you are still a planet.
Yes it's probably like when women cry rape for being hollered at and it waters down the real meaning of sexual violence.
Why they would only get messages bout how brave they r
You are obviously a troll. Not even a good one. If you're trying to make this sub look racist it's not going to work. Hell, a good portion of our users are different races.

I mean, it's not TERRIBLE... This sub isn't about hating on anyone that is even slightly overweight, we're about fighting the fatpride kinda shit that is invading our culture. Right?

Fuuuck yeeees! Holy shit yes. Why haven't i thought about that? That's brilliant OP.
Don't just rant about it here, call the hams out on their bullshit the next time you see them. Personally berate them the next time they pull that shit.
Holy shit I fucking hate vanity sizing. It makes it impossible to buy stuff online. I think Under Armour is the only store I've found who doesn't do vanity sizing. I actually had to size up to a medium for their compression shirts.
I need to meet this girl.
The fact that she hasn't become an amputee to the beetus yet is impressive to say the least

*If you were to ask a fat person if they would rather be skinny, I'm pretty sure most every one of them would say "YES!".*For those indoctrinated by FA, I'm not so sure. But I agree, those who say YES want it by magic. They'd love to be normal, as long as they don't have to change one single thing about themselves.
Fat people in Under Armour compression shirts make me laugh so hard. It's not actually gonna compress you bro, you just look like an idiot and you're ruining a $50 shirt.
I had no idea about that, they hijack anything that actual disabled people can use. Society should really stop enabling the fatties, what do they bring to our society, other than overeating, over-consuming, whining and draining health care?
This is by far one of the most disgusting things I have ever seen.
You're a ding dong. We hate fat people for their fat because it's something about them that they are capable of changing. We don't hate people for their race because that's something no one can change.
Lardpiggies will use anything as an excuse for being a lardpiggy
No, its the bullshit people tend to drench with butter. Saturated fats aren't that bad for you.

Stop for fuel : do jumping jacks while pumping. Stop to piss: run to the end of the parking lot and back. And I piss a lot; comes along with drinking at least 1gal of water daily. You have a mandatory 30 min break before you hit 8 hours of drive time: 15 to eat and 15 to workout, it's fucking perfect. My trainer used to cuss me for making him stop every 2 hours to piss, but he was a fat fucking slob. And I'm not, thank god.
Whose choice would it be if it weren't theirs? Your heart's in the right place, but it doesn't make sense. It's your **choice** is far more powerful for exactly the reason you gave. Fats aren't at the mercy of their environment, but of their hoof-to-mouth interpretation of life.
"was"Also, why aren't you verified?
Uh, no. For her height (5'5), 90-100 pounds would be very underweight, giving her a BMI of 15.0-16.6. It's disgusting to glorify obesity, but you shouldn't glorify anorexia/being underweight either.A healthy weight range for her height is 111-149 lbs.
Sure, I hate fat people, but I hate women who wear unreasonable shoes almost just as much.... Hard to sympathize with her really.
Melissa dropped all her fatlogic and started working as a counselor for others, she's actually pretty awesome.
It was difficult stifling my laughter. She explained to me that some people find it offensive. I pretended to give a shit simply because I didn't want to jeopardize my membership, but the minute my daughter and I got back in the car, I high fived her.
Nobody gives a shit.
When you're fat enough, your excrement doesn't even escape your fat folds to warrant a diaper, you just wait til you get to a shower and dispose of it then I'd imagine. It sort of just marinates in there throughout the day, any thick clothing is to help hide the smell. Eventually your skin toughens up from the abuse and becomes your own natural leather diaper.
The Clergy part pisses me off in so many ways. Fucking pewbeasts.
Keep on lifting and don't do more than 300-400 kcal deficit.
Are there fat people you don't hate? I'm just trying to gauge the intolerance here so I can feel better about the human race
Plenty of people like fat people, I don't know where they hell you come from but fat girls get laid too. I personally like fat girls.
This mother fucker doesn't know the power of shitler does he. He get to go last in the chambers, just so he can smell the rotting corpses of all those fat fucks he seems to enjoy. He can sit in the chamber and inhale the putrid air from them just existing and then we will see this pig fucker break. And then and only then will he be allowed to die, after he concides they are disgusting rotting flesh bags, after we've broken his will so thoroughly he understand that we of the shatzi party won't stand for his beastiality or their disgusting lifestyle of parasitic breeding. SHITHEIL!
I sent in my verification again last night, because one of the mods had asked me for a timestamp and I still haven't heard anything... Does this mean I didn't make the muscle definition cut or do I not post enough?
Awesome.This mail reads like fuckin' poetry. &lt;3
I want to know too!
In school when I was pissed at a teacher and decided to walk with friends our miles were on average 19-20 mins even. Bitch fucking strolled along..took a break and then another.
This woman is a good 70-100lbs overweight from the looks of it. 10lbs in six months is not progress, that's natural summer winter fluctuation. No wonder the dr ignored it.
Reminds me of Jon LaJoie : "Guns don't kill people, nuh uh! I kill people: WITH. GUNS."
Their stench makes me cry.
That's great, you get paid to shitlord people"if you don't lose the weight you're not going to be able to walk at all in 10 years"(*but if you do lose the weight...*) is probably a required part of it as a profession
I think it's hilarious that these flabgoblins are giving them so much free advertising. PW doesn't care how many obeasts hate them - not their target demographic. Meanwhile, us shitlords are cackling madly and checking out their products.
Are you sure it's female?
Dat neck-fat tho
Cankles...But with cleavage...Booankles?
If you're the 'face' of a company (like a secretary) it is wise to not post or have pictures of you wasted on social. Most of my friends use fake names on social for this very reason. Also, don't add people from work that could fire you!
I understand your pain. It truly is annoying. I use both a 360 controller and mouse but I have yet to see someone pose with a mouse lol
Even with a sedentary lifestyle you could eat pizza or hamburgers every day, in moderation, and not be fat. Seriously.
Omfg puke
That's gold-digging, very different.
What I don't get, is why they take all this time to make a shitty way of living easier instead of taking care of themselves.

How does that work?
True, when I want to lose weight I just eat 1200 calories a day and it drops off in no time I barely do any exercise.
Nah, dude. It's the objective form. As in, "Who wants to hang out with me and Batman?"

Perfumes/colognes/body sprays/etc...I hate it.
I loved the Hamthrax stories. I'm also liking the new Fedorus series, manily because the fatty hasn't once whined about his condishuns and the author is willing to admit that he is an asshole. Not the "cool, rebellious asshole" trope, but an actual, stupidly abrasive asshole.

Most of my bullies growing up were fat. Not just chubby, fat. As an adult, the rudest, meanest, most inconsiderate people I know are also very fat. In fact, even just the slightly rude and inconsiderate people I know are fat, with the exception of a small number of thin people (a few of whom are mostly mean because of the fat people they hang out with/are married to, though). With few exceptions, fit, healthy people are generally more tolerant of others, especially if they're not behaving like dicks or spewing dumb crap. It's the fat people who tend to be bullies, mostly because they're insecure or compensating.
Found the fatty!
Mmmmmm. You said cake!
That almond and soft drink line was taken straight from the documentary *Fed Up*. I guess that counts as research these days.

How do you eat rocks? Like, how is she still alive? How have the rocks not wrecked her intestinesIt's probably fake but come on.
I kept waiting for someone to run up and help her... Nope, draw the curtains and take Bessie out behind the shed. I can't watch this enough.
I think the fupa designation requires a fold. Which isn't to say sub-fupa fats don't deserve hate, but I don't think she's overweight anyway.
There are actually two things that are called chubby. One is a bird and one is a boner.
I just felt my penis go inside me from that obeast, and I've been in 20 degree ice water with compression shorts.... and that thing made it go in farther

From not being able to comprehend why FPH exists to the claim that "people don't post pictures on Facebook to show off unless they're, like, a celebrity", I don't get the impression that butterball here is particularly seasoned in the tides and eddies of this little stream called "life".In case she finds this post I would just like to say:Boo fucking hoo. You're fat as fuck. Not just overweight. You are fucking lard obsessed. Looking at that jiggly flesh abortion you call a body is repulsive to anyone with a functioning sense of sight. Sorry, but none of us made that rule, easy as it is blaming us for the fact that there is no MySpace angle great enough to hide the effects that years of "rewarding" and "comforting" yourself with processed food and sugar every time you so much as changed that stretched out airship canvas you call a "shirt" has had on your body. Hell, even you agree with me. Pull up a picture of some gigantic fat man with rolls spilling everywhere. Now pull up a shirtless Chris Hemsworth. Which one is getting your thick, greasy juices flowing? But it's totally different when it's *you*, right? We just need to get to know your personality! You're fun and quirky and sweet and being fat doesn't define you! Right. It's almost like we've heard it all before, from a million fatties. Each absolutely convinced that they're special and different.The only crime anyone here at FPH has committed is being honest with you fucking greasebeasts. The fact that you would rather attempt to force us to accept you as attractive through censorship and browbeating rather than simply following the few simple steps it takes to actually be attractive shows an embarrassing level of self-absorption and can only lead anyone not looking to hammer another nail into your hugbox to conclude that you're just as fucking repulsive on the inside as you are on the out.You could change right now. You could take an honest look at yourself in the mirror and realize that within a few months you could actually be those things you delude yourself into thinking you are. You could have a moment of clarity and finally understand that the way you live your life is disgusting to literally everyone, and anyone telling you otherwise is lying to you to either preserve your feelings or to drag you back into the same shitty hole that they themselves can't escape from. You could download a calorie tracker app and ask for fitness tips from the endless number of Internet sources and start *right fucking now*.But you won't.You'll keep telling yourself you're "curvy" and "voluptuous". You'll keep convincing yourself that it's fine to have that third cheeseburger since you "must have walked like five miles today" and "probably burned about 4000 calories". The delusion that you can't get matches on Tinder because you don't have any good pictures and everyone that rejects you is just a shallow asshole will be your daily comfort as you casually swipe past men or women that weigh less than you, yet are still not attractive to you because of their weight. You'll keep trying to silence the only people that aren't lying to keep you miserable, and when everyone has been forcibly quieted and your precious feelings are sufficiently protected, your ultimate reward will be that you get to be fucking fat and disgusting forever. Congratulations, you sure as fuck earned it.Just never fucking forget that no matter what anyone tells you, YOU are the problem, and it's YOUR fucking fault. Not us.
Oh well...as long as it was that one....
I am 19 but started working at a firm that is filled with well aged women. Ive never found older women attractive until I started here. There are some 65 year olds I would love to be with
It's very common.
crying because harassment doesn't make people do what you wantboo hhoooo go to an official signing or meet and greet. Don't bum rush celebrities in their every day life.
So hungry she's reingesting her own fat until she reaches the fridge.
RUNNNNN!! wait or just a brisk walk and I'm sure you'll get there before they gobble up all the food from the buffet...
That's awesome. I would shop there and I don't even drink tea.
Pull-ups :) if you can do 8 pull-ups without stopping you have a great head start
The only thing more disgusting than those girls are the fucking low life juggalos out there getting off to seeing them topless.

Looks like a Ditto to me, giant pile of blobiness with no distinguishable features.
One word. Dildostick
As always, Shitm'lord.
She looks like she is exhausted from just standing there. She doesn't even have the energy to lift her face fat for a proper smile.
Does she realize eating nothing but bacon will not help her absorb Miss Piggy's soul?
thermodynamics don't real
If it makes you feel any better, I was messaged today by an "asexual agender" who uses they/them pronouns, lol. I will admit she was thin and pretty, though.Still, I wish OKC had more questions about sociopolitical views that divide up libertarians, sane liberals, and SJW types. I'm a 25-year-old fit white libertarian male with a STEM job at a Fortune 500 in Texas. I drive a sports car to the gym to lift weights then go back to my apartment and eat meat. I AM THE PATRIARCHY!The one upside would be degrading them... But anyway, just ignore it and add "if you take fitness and health seriously" to your "message me if..." section!
That's a seriously fat hog at the end. Never seen one that fat in real life, it's almost impossible to do in the wild.
"She suffers from Othello Syndrome"Uh, I don't think that filthy creature is the one who is suffering.
Its a defense/coping mechanism. Its a lot easier to blame others weakness instead of their own for LittleDiebetus snack cakes.
Thin privilege is knowing which way is up.
She would only know how to contour a fat face so she'd probably fuck it up pretty bad
People need to separate *fat as a health issue* from *fat as a political issue.*
Well, she's certainly fat... even if her ex was an actual asshole in other ways, he was telling her the truth.
♫ *Doo dah, doo dah* ♫
You can easily get there by building muscle. Just remember to balance bulk cycles with cutting, so you add lean mass not lard mass.
"went to a psychologist for the first time for my anxiety/depression"..."I kept telling her I was HAPPY with the way I was"This 200 lb overweight cow is at the psychologist because she's "happy"
That's the most disgusting part. God she must smell.
And *that* is the real tragedy...they deny their own potential.
No, it's from a thread I was watching elsewhere.
There are two types of people here.There are people who are genuinely interested in having an exchange (blanketed in an often-humorous, hateful tone) concerning the economic and psychosocial problems surrounding obesity and its glorification, and there are people who just feel like hating.Every single thread in this sub has at least one heavily-downvoted comment from a fatty claiming we're all hateful losers with no lives. It pains me that sometimes they're right.Guys, don't let the fatties be right.
*Look at how random and "cute" I am guiizzz!!*

I put something similar on my Okcupid page. All I get is tons of hate about how I don't deserve them anyway. I just want someone that isn't fat/can fit in with my lifestyle. Why is that so hard to find?
Heh...I read the text. Admits to "overcompensating" (really? we never noticed!) and insists she's not suicidal. Uh, every time she EATS, she's on her way to suicide.
I hate this guy. He is literally the most annoying fuck on Food Network. He is so fucking hyper and everything is the, "best thing he has ever had."If it makes any of you shitlords feel better, I have heard he is a real dick off camera.
I wished I owned a clothing store. I'd gladly take their money and make size 5xl and charge them 10x for it. Fuck em
Poe's law in action.
I thought I had a stalker earlier but it didn't eventuate. Screen shots, stay calm.
Hating fatties is the fun of this sub. If you want to have fun pulling pointless and confusing pranks, go ahead, but in another sub.
Vaginal size, like penis size, is also genetically determined. Some women have larger, some have smaller.

This. The way he looks really makes me rage.
Can't be bothered opening eyelids fully, burns too many calories.
Holy shit her fat ate her neck.
&gt; she'd rather eat how she wants, and be happy than be skinny.That's the exact thing I hear from my obese family. What they don't understand is that being skinny and fit MAKES ME HAPPY. Much happier than the fleeting enjoyment of bad food. And my quality of life is so good! How can huge greasy sugar filled meals compete with that? They just don't know the difference, I guess.
Fuck yes it was.
Sweet Jesus. The fat is running out of places to go and is collecting on her nose. That is a fat nose. I have never seen one of those.
Well, the fungus looks like it's healthy.
This is my first response to any post. I feel like I NEED to say this..fat shaming has worked and is working for me. I found this sub a little over two months ago and it was just the motivation I needed! I signed up for the gym and have lost 32 lbs already, 25 more to go but that's ok. When I started I could not run for 30 seconds without feeling like I was going to die. I can now run 5 miles solid...yes in two months I made myself do it. I read this sub more obsessively. It is completely because of shame and embarrassment that I lost and am still losing. I could go on and on but I think shortly I will create a new post with pics just to thank all everyone on here for the constant motivation. FAT SHAMING WORKS!!!
Barrel rider! That is interesting...
Yeah she is super beautiful...hilarious to see the fatsos fuming....
Thanks. I think I've seen it, or similar ones, before. It's nothing but delusional self talk.
17? Damn. She's doomed. I know about imgur, but my iPad is old and was literally struck by lightening, lol. It does not get along well with imgur, for some reason.
It's also trolling btw. When the principle moderator of a forum that's supposedly not about the drama dupes thousands of users about another moderator's death (abusing mod powers with a sticky thread too lol), which incidentally caused a massive amount of stress and work for that other moderator, it's a very immature and shitty way to behave for the sake of a joke even a moron could see was going to go over like a lead balloon.Hence the obvious conclusion it was done for the trolololulz at the expense of community.Honestly the sort of thing I would expect from someone 15 or younger and makes me wonder about TPW's age.
Me too! I was unsure at first but my step dad convinced me to train with him and the fat is history.
Don't encourage that kind of behaviour. Seriously, you'll just set yourself up for failure. The kind of people who act that entitled, will just bring you more drama and entitlement. :p
Literally top post of this week.
I want her to die a painful death. She thinks she is so "progressive"
He probably already claims disability. He might as well just have it removed.
Which is counter intuitive given that buoyancy could never sink. They could keep the Titanic afloat.
I'll give it a whirl:- She sexually molested her sister when the sister was 7- She kept "buying kisses" from her sister for 10 years after that- She claimed a guy in college raped her, which has been proven false and he might sue- The internet (i.e. Tumblr/Twitter-tards) went after the wrong dude for the alleged rapeI probably missed some, but that's the ones I've run into.
Orders diet coke with its supersized multiple meals.
People with Prader-Willi often have learning difficulties, and some of them need 24/7 monitoring to make sure they aren't eating themselves to death. Some can learn to be independent and understand they have a disorder, and so be careful of what and how much they are eating.It's really sad. They lack the chemical in the brain that tells them they are full.
one ankle is bigger than my thigh
Huh?
I'd say it's all the sugar. When I've relapsed (like when Surge was re-released on Amazon, and a friend brought me one), I noticed increased anxiety afterwards. But hey, Surge. It was worth it for the nostalgia trip.
Yeah this is the only captcha I would enjoy. Put this everywhere. Hell, make it my phone unlock.
Thank you for finding another amazing lard bucket hashtag.
Eh, riveting warplanes to fight the greatest single human force ever amassed; or eating a whole bag of Cheetos while fighting the patriarchy on Tumblr. Literally indistinguishable.
To a shitlord, a diet means what it means to animals. A diet being what one primarily eats. To a fatfuck a diet is a brief change in eating habits. They don't ever understand that a diet is a conistent, long term thing, not something you do to lose weight and then go back to eating like a fucking pig.
She looks like the girl who turned into a blueberry in willie wonka. The raspberry version.
That pizza has mushrooms on it, shitlord! I can't really stand the sight of pizza now unless there's a shit tonne of veggies on it and minimal cheese.
Was Pam being in the background intentional? Because if so nice touch
You know the struggle. That's basically what I do. I try to journal or make lists - somehow writing things down makes me calm down and at least try to be rational. And they're very "me centered" - I try to avoid "so-and-so said this, and that made me do this", but rather "I reacted to this situation in this way". Then I can go back over it and see if I was being ridiculous. If left in my own head, shit gets weird.
Well done! That's a prize from the middle level!
You are dumb and you should feel dumb
Was going to say the same thing, she was so attention starved
I just don't understand how they can look in the mirror and think that in that state, they're presentable enough to go outside
Even if you might win a lawsuit, the real financial advantage is in avoiding it to begin with. Litigation is expensive as fuck.
I have never seen anything more horrid.
It's like these fatties thinks that just because you got a gut you can be a "model". No no no.First of all you're fat. Second of all you're face looks like roadkill. I'm fit but I am no where near as "face" pretty as a real model.What ever happened to being realistic?
I feel like some stuff he just he goes over board with but I like when he compares actual obeast/normal people organs to show how bad it is
Or, at the very LEAST if she fell, she should make it so that she does more damage to HERSELF than the child.I've been roller blading/ ice skating before and a kid has stopped short right in front of me (as I'm trying to maneuver away) and I've pulled off seriously painful moves/controlled falls so that I don't run into the damn midget. AND NOT EVEN MY OWN KID, SOMEONE ELSE'S.

Yeah, this reminds me of rich white girls. Vodka waters and skittles at their myriad preening appointments. Hot yoga pants for day to day activities: mandatory.
What comes first: the lack of ambition, or the stupid fatness?
My question is, why would you guys nominate a fat legacy in the first place? Like what is the process with selecting the person to be voted on by the chapter?

Remember, a size zero in Europe is smaller than a size zero in America. There are never hams on the runway for any real fashion shows. I don't think you need to worry about that happening, fat sample sizes would cost far too much to make plus they would make the clothes look ugly with their disgusting bloated flesh sack bodies.
Sorry about that, I thought the likes and shares was pretty indicative of the overall feeling that everyone has had enough of hams and their disgusting bodies.
I just want to go up to a fatty and offer to pay for their meal. Watch them order some large meal and wait for it to get here and then just leave them stuck with the food and Bill.

Aside from being gross in the body, her face is BEAT. I Always feel kinda meh about gastric bypass. Like on one hand it's good that that's an option, but then they always want to brag about it, and expect accolades. Like congrats, you got really fat and got surgery to lose the weight. Wahoo all the balloons! /s
What a surprise, a fat fuck has no willpower.
Some even have extra ordinary dicks. Not just ordinary. They are so ordinary they are extra ordinary
Oh god was it one of those people who eats like 40 pieces of large fruit per day and somehow isn't aware that thats like 4000 calories?

Great. So you can get me a job? Thanks!
I like talking about how my boyfriend loves how small I am, and how it's so easy for him to pick me up and do curls with me lol it's hilarious because they've probably never been picked up by a significant other
Idk I don't think anyone is trying to be the moral authority, but if some men's rights issues intersect with feminist issues i don't see why feminism shouldn't help out a bit. But that's just my opinion and FPH isn't really the place for feminism debates :p

Yeah, I know :/ Id go back to normal colors, but I cant bring myself to do it. At least I keep up with my coloring, whereas most fatties definitely dont.
'gay' or 'homosexual' is fine. 'homos' is most often used as a slur.
I was about to say that being fat doesn't mean he's a bad singer.Then the song loaded.Now I'm upset.
I think that, in very limited cases, it's beneficial. If you're attending school or at (most types of) work, you're not going to want to be in an environment that makes "fear of harassment" at the forefront of your mind instead of the task at hand. A teacher shouldn't be able to call a student a racial slur just like a gay person shouldn't have to put up with slurs from his boss. But in regular, everyday speech? Who cares? People say shit all the time.
Eat a bullet, psycho.
"I can see my dogs rib cage, that's disgusting"No, you're meant to be able to see your dogs ribs (if they have short fur)
all u can say is fatty because ur 'healthy' food has chemicals scientifically proven to steal souls
I appreciate that very much! I'm actually a student teacher right now, in music education. I know teaching is a hard job - all the more reason to give the kids (and yourself) a 15 minute un-structured breather.
Seriously, why the fuck would anyone post that kind of photo? Do they walk around in public exposing their nasty rashes at passers by? Absolutely nobody wants to see that. These people can only behave like this on tumblr or other similar internet echo chamber. In the real world, if they were to flap out their disgusting, rotting body parts while screeching about how "cute" they are, they would mercilessly shamed (and rightfully so).

They're not farts, fatties call them "meal scrapbooking."
This shit drives me fucking nutty. Through some mutual friends, I get to see these fucking hams on Facebook.  Fat fuck status: "No one wants to hear about your workout unless you fell off the treadmill." Next five fucking statuses: "Om nom nom [insert picture of enough food for a family of five on a single plate]"  Why in the fuck is it okay to bitch out people who are taking care of themselves (I mean, talking about ANYTHING too much is annoying, granted) but no one says boo when these hamplanets broadcast the high octane CRAP they feed themselves on a regular basis.
while true. it means that fatty shouldnt have ordered it in the first place. stop sympathizing..
I think anyone entertaining the thought of weight loss surgery needs to be forced to look at the dissected corpses of eatbeasts who kept eating like pigs after the surgery. Gastric rupture, peritonitis, how the stomach acid dissolved their abdominal cavity and they died screaming. This is why you have to prove that you can change your lifestyle *before* your surgery request is approved. Anyone who says, "that won't happen to me" is blacklisted for life.

Lots of fatties in the touristy parts of NYC for sure, mostly visitors from the biscuits 'n gravy states. You'll also find some in the less hip parts of the outer boroughs. NYC is still a walking city so it'll be harder to find the really huge specimens. Don't forget to snap a photo of a struggling family of obeasts attempting to walk across Central Park!
Huh. That's interesting. So hams are less gross in naturist communities than fit people?
yea they treat the drama in the show is more important than their life.i am to legit to quit nowwhy do you think im messin'
Yeah, I was banned from /r/offmychest as well for not arselicking a fattie. That sub is seriously ''love fatties and tell them they are pretty or be banned''

I don't use an alt, and post to several sub's with a strongly large population. I have yet to get any hate over it. Your post makes me think it's just a ticking time bomb.
I've become so jaded about hams, nothing surprises me any more. Of course fatfucks do things like this. I wouldn't be surprised if it just shat its pants, threw them out, and bought a new pair every time it had to go. It'd be less effort, so I'm sure it'd be right up its alley.

I actually had this conversation earlier this week. A girl I know said she gained weight a couple years ago when she tried to go vegetarian. She was always hungry and ended up eating way more shit like cookies and french fries and potato chips than usual. (Fortunately, she lost it and is very attractive now!)
I bet you were watching those yoga pants stretch to oblivion. Admit it.
Oh good god I spent five minutes in another sub trying to make a joke referencing Icarus and I come here and do it accidentally.
I don't understand why she only wants to lose 100 pounds. She will still be super fucking fat.
Holy shit, you have a lot of time on your hands. I'd like you to point out how any of that shows I'm not a physician.
Somebody doesn't understand BDSM...
It's still a way of identifying.
Why so serious-ly overweight?!
Nice of you to step up! some people in here was skeptical about it. Thanks for this!
You go to make out and a sludge of tobacco, saliva, and cancer greets you. No thank you! The only dip I've done is the ground beef jerky.
Of course they do! They OD on dreamfield pasta and other low carb fankenfood mixed in with a ton of bacon then 20 pounds of sugar free candy and chocolate, topped off with a sugar laden doughnut hole because they deserve a reward for being so healthy. Hamplanet keto ftw!! /s
Story time, I'm on mobile so I apologize in advance for typos.In 2008 when I went to basic training for the Army there was a fatty in my company. I was in the first group to make it through reception and go to our actual barracks. We got there on Tuesday and training started on Friday. This meant that we had the drill sergeants' undivided attention and we got the shit smoked out of us constantly. After getting off the bus and getting smoked for a couple hours we had to march from the PT area to our barracks. This required that we march down a long hill, it wasn't steep at all. Fat boy was directly in front of me and he was pretty terrible at marching. Something about staying in step and having to go down the hill just didn't compute with him. He somehow got tripped up and fell forward and just started to roll down the hill. I could not stop laughing and even the drill sergeant was having trouble keeping a straight face.
I tempted to buy a shirt, then use it as my workout shirt. The reactions I would get would be priceless.
Best way to hide a fupa, is to not have a fupa.
Well I am saying this as a 19 year old so
&gt;no big dealIt's funny because they're fat
Damn. I was expecting it to be a [Vampiric Spektor](URL
She's not pregnant, she's gaining on purpose. That's just fucking crazy, I don't get it. I think people like this need to be in mental hospital and get treated.
I can imagine they're quite heavy, too.
although "tings" is also a accepted pronounciation
Man how embarrassing
I bet she does
[Bedsheets too](URL
In her natural habitat.
And then ate the potato with sour cream and bacon bits.
Make that fat fuck try to lift a 400 pound patient onto a gurney with only one other person helping. Fucking wake-up call.
That is one large wall of text just to say "wah I'm totally fat because reasons, not because I can't put down the pizza."
There aren't enough vitamins and minerals in the food to stay healthy. I bet he's malnourished.**Edit** : Hey downvoting fatties, read this while you're waiting around for your heart attack you fat tubs of shit: &gt;[The mistake is to think that if you eat an abundance of calories, your diet automatically delivers all the nutrients your body needs.

Most ped5-inhibitors like cialis or viagra are not dangerous if you are healthy. They are actually a good way to lower blood pressure ( on cycle ).Here comes the fun part, they do not make you horny. They just make you hard :D.So he will have to fuck his boar whilst he is not horny and still find her repulsive, this prolly one of the funniest posts I have read.
Fupaception
It's a new nightmare that I'll hold on to for the next week probably.
I feel pity for her. This has to be a kind of mental illness. Why else would you do this to yourself?
No way is she only 280 lbs. Nor is she the size 22/24 she claims. Even fat girls have asked her how she fits into a 24 when they (who seem slightly smaller) cannot.
Aw you make me happy too :).
Some sharks can detect blood at one part per million. Hamplanets can detect Mountain Dew at around the same levels. I would suggest not attracting the attention of either, during a feeding frenzy.
All that money into fat people lifting equipment could have been put into other more useful things.
Yeah, considering most generic foot fetishists like attractive feet, it would take a special kind of fucked up to like this foot. Someone like a HAES activist.
I honestly feel bad for you if you truly think you look healthy and have "visible abs". You have a visible flab on your gut, that is about it. You know a true yoga workout should be about an hour and half? It takes about 45 minutes for your muscles to truly warm up in yoga. Not to mention, you don't really "gain" muscle from yoga. Yoga trains flexibility and stability. 185 is huge for your height. I mean, you got college football players at 6'1" 200-210 lbs going to the nfl...they are fucking ripped. They have nearly a full foot of height on you and dense, lean muscle and you think they only have a 15-25lb difference? I'm truly embarrassed and sad for you. I hope one day you wake up from your fantasy.
I own a cat who is a twist tie fetcher (like the little twist ties on loaves of bread?). I bought a roll of green twist tie twine to hang up garland for Christmas. He wrecked my decorations just to get at the twist ties.
I'm pretty sure this is the most disgusting thing I've seen all week.
Man, Boxxy sure got fat!
I have my magic.
In what universe is this 'beautiful'? They're just trying to rob the word of any meaning.

She has, but she rolled over in her sleep and smothered the last two.

This just screams, 'LOOK, I HAVE SEX. LOOK AT ME.'
Or you could do what im going to do and treat her like a princess and by that i mean when shes 16 im gonna lock her ass up in a castle and buy a dragon to guard her....if some dude slays the dragon shes all his
I thought it was a colloquialism... nope. Literal bed sheet.
I wish my gym had this. I would so watch a movie while on the treadmill.
Well it is a pig with makeup, but it looks like a clown.
&gt;I was eating basically all natural foods, nothing processed, a few months ago and it is HARD AS HELL to eat even 1200 calories in chicken, fish, fruits, etc. And yet he still offers me "advice."I HATE WHEN THIS HAPPENS. My planet coworker eats out all the time and calls me out for" not eating enough." I made the mistake of telling her I've been eating low-carb, high-protein (ketogenic diet for seizures, yay!) and now she pokes and prods whenever I eat just salad. "You never eat. You should eat more than that. You're missing out." No, no i'm not. I'm taking care of my body and not shoving my face full of full-(saturated/trans)fat crap like you. How dare I enjoy fresh fruit and vegetables unlike that fake food you eat. Ugh. Also, it's hard eating over 1200 kcals of fruit and veg with some added meat protein. That was my original point.
LOL until this moment I didn't know they made double wide caskets. I thought double wide was just for the trailer park!
Racism is stupid, and this isn't loseit, Take that fat sympathy elsewhere.*Banned*
Story??
Kneeling on the ground.
Thanks, all!
/u/not_the_real_name confirmed for epic truth-teller.
Bad news: I'm gonna have to start sacrificing gains in order to work on cardio =(. The fireman test that I hope to take a few months from now includes a running portion, and I'd rather not lose out on this opportunity just because I dislike running.I'm still lifting 3x a week, but I've started doing an hour of cardio as well afterwards. Hopefully I don't lose out too much because of it; nothing against runners and their physique, but I'd rather have the body of a running back instead.
Maybe she means she can touch them together???
Every time I hear a teenage girl speak I want to shoot myself in the mouth. I like can't even right now.
Aww geez, I'm all giddy now. Thank you!
No, they're fat. May not be obese, but overweight = fat.

Welcome to Texas. I'm "asking" to get raped -.- I don't want a few places that are clothing optional. I want to be able go topless whenever and wherever I want. Dudes can do it, why can't I?
Trick question, he is his own universe. Both in mind and body.
well i guess we have to settle on agreeing on one point then atleast!
My brother!
That's why she duck faces too, it sucks in your cheeks and makes your cheek bones more prominent, off on her "more prominent" means "just slightly less covered in ham spackling "
Since it requires fitness, perhaps you could establish some fitness tests.
Don't worry, it's in the process of beaching itself.
This happened to me one time. I went to a walk in clinic just to get a check up and they told me they were going to let this new girl take my blood because she needed the practice. She kept jabbing it in and out and couldn't get it right, it felt like she was trying to fuck my arm with the needle. I never had a fear of needles before and I was trying to remain calm, and after what felt like forever I asked them if I could just reschedule but they wouldn't let me. It left a huge bruise.
Attention. "Look how hard I'm trying! Looooook aaaaaat meeeeeee!!!" Then when they quit a month later they can say "Look how hard I was working and **nothing happened**. Guess it is my genetics after all...lemme have that cheesecake."
Those turkey wings!! Gobble Gobble Gobble
I'm told I stare at everyone a little too hard and that I have a staring problem, but I'm especially bad with fat people. Particularly if they're eating (I need to lurk them and find out what they're shoving into their maw). The other day I saw a superwhale at the grocery store who was feasting on her groceries before she even got to the counter to pay for them. I mean she had some kind of finger food open and was smothering it into some kind of hummus dip while walking around the store, just absolutely gorging. At one point she stopped walking in the middle of an aisle just so she could mash more hummus-y goodness into her suckhole. Completely obliterating the fuck out of hundreds of calories while staring vacantly into space. I don't even need to tell you she was wearing leggings instead of pants. It was so fucking nasty, yet I could not look away for the life of me.
In all fairness your fireship, he was suffering from [this.](URL
Honestly, it's getting to the point where they annoy me so much that I actually am considering distancing myself. This has been going on for 3 years. I agree with you that the only people that change are those who want it. Hopefully they'll get there eventually!
I know you're all proud shitlords, but unless you are a completely sedentary 100lbs female you should not eat &lt;1500kcal a day. Loosing muscle doesn't help anyone's looks/health.URL

I hate humanity so badly sometimes.
You could use those magnets that look like bumper stickers. That way you won't get in trouble for destruction of property. I saw a comedian a few years ago who sold those for putting on people's cars who drive/park like shit. Hilarious.
The resemblance is striking.
Reminds me of Grimace.
There was a really great one last week about how obeasts buy expensive branded goods to make themselves feel better and the shitlord said the obeast was toting an MK purse.. It's one thing to hate the obeasity and another to just be sour about not being able to afford stuff that others do. To consider MK an expensive branded good is hilarious.
Since when do hams stop eating when satiated? Overeating is par for the course. I don't think most of them know what feeling satiated is like unless they feel ready to explode with the next bite.
So much wasted potential.
Dat logic. Never question why the answer to most common complaints to GPs is to lose weight as the patient is most likely overweight."Doc I think I have trouble sleeping?""Lose weight""Doc I'm have erectile issues""Lose weight""Doc I feel rundown and have no energy""Lose weight"
She was fat before and after prison. She is believing herself to not be fat enough and wants more food. Her name is Amber Portwood. Hamber Port(ly)wood.
I don't see them.. They're land mass.
Where dies fat begin?
That's what the goal is :) thanks! I just started recently working out but I never really knew what to do to get what I was looking for. Is there somewhere online you get your workouts from? I have no idea what I'm doing haha
So true. This is for all those skinny-fats out there.
Being fat is against the rules of the sub. So yeah, he broke a rule and got banned. Whether or not you agree with that rule is a different argument.
? I mean don't drink. Jeez have some self control you dumb fatlogic
It's not very accurate... You can still clearly see collar bones... Maybe it's a fetish with just fat faces?
Yes, yes, and yes. Shitlords, remember to use this post to convert others into shitlordism if they give you some fat sympathy bullshit.
It is going to be ok guys. The girl can still be a "Model".This is so many degrees of wrong!
Really? I thought he'd been faithful till near the end, when he got with Roxanna, which lead to the breakup of his marriage. He was such a devout Catholic, after all.
That's just bizarre, what was she even talking about? Most everyone I know, all under 25, would pick fried chicken and french fries over anything related to vegetables or the like. Not just the fat ones either.…Saying it like that, it makes them sound a bit like 5 year olds.
Size 11s unite! Big feet with slender ankles are so much better than small hooves with massive cankles.
Nice looking lady you've got there. Well done. Too bad about the porker though.
This has got to be one of the stupidest diatribes on have ever read. Don't expect a woman to be able to handle my doubts and fears? Have you ever been in a real, mature relationship? Or even married? I wouldn't have a partner I couldn't share my fears and doubts with.
Butter huffer :thumbs_up:

Loved it too.
Agreed, the whole "bier en frituur" thing is getting out of hand on some people.
How can it be real if our eyes aren't real?

Nasty teeth, nasty skin, nasty nails. Just your average ham.

Does L.A. have a need for Allergists? If so, I'm definitely packing my bags and heading out.
I saw the URL description and was like, "how bad could it be?". Yikes. Even after being on FPH for several months that photo still surprised me.
Yeah, but that still doesn't mean it's all that great.I'm just speaking from experience, I own a pair and have tried the different "point methods" and what not. All of the different readings I got with different formulas placed me way lower than I actually was. I have two other friends who are into fitness and have a pair, they had the same results.I haven't used them in a long time because they are pretty bad in my opinion, but they for sure had me at around 8%, when there is no way I was a hair under 15%.
Shitlord, did you work there long? If so Grannyshitlord INSISTS that you take your "tiny" butt down to U.I. You were not fired for good cause. You were fired because a hamplanet was acting suspiciously like they were gonna grab the pizzas and slam the door without signing. I can promise you, if company policy was to get the paper signed before handing over the goods.....you were wrongfully terminated. Too bad you don't have any friends who could, behind your back (plausible deniability) send all and sundry weight loss program sign-ups to her house. Or put an add in the classifieds "Blow Out Biker Blast! Free whiskey and buck knives to the first 30 Bikers!" with her address.
A+ wrangling. Would watch again.
FA, banned.
That's an oxymoron of epic proportions
Can i mention... you're playing their game.A bunch of fat cunts have created their own echo chamber on the internet, congratulating themselves online about how they're breaking down beauty standards, teaching people not to be brainwashed by the mass media, and fighting oppresshiuns.Meanwhile... in the real world... where people actually walk... there is a good proportion of the population who cares not one iota for these lazy fucks.We are in supermarkets, striding past their greaseoramas as we look for something that'll actually be mildly nutritious.We are wandering through shopping centres, browsing and buying clothes that cost less to make while they stuff their maw in the food court, bitching about how nothing fits them.We are getting looks from attractive strangers that aren't filled with repulsion.We are successfully dodging their over sized piles of blubber they call their bodies in the interim they aren't gazing at their television, claiming oppression on tumblr, or just downvoting a bunch of oppressive cunts on reddit because we deserve it.Fucking hell. We're giving them the attention they crave so badly. But the best part is what does it matter?While they're in their dark room, posting about oppresshiuns, us, us of fatpeoplehate will be making lives of ourselves, exploring the planet and actually do the work to improve earth, rather than just whine about how bad it is.
Nah, the huge dudes at the gym are almost always the most helpful people you will find there.
My husband claims to want me to be skinny and doesn't want me to get "bulky" (I know women usually don't, but I put on muscle mass pretty easily), yet he keeps praising my "sexy muscles." I'm so confused. Someone help me.
If they're smart, that's what they'll use this sub for.
Well if they were as considerate they would've bought two seats.
&gt; All it does is make you lose your momentum and basically confuses your leg muscles, making a 10 mile hike feel like 15.But think about all your gainz from the muscle confusion!! /sarc I went hiking with a friend and one of his former coworkers once, and the coworker was exactly like this, and it just made the whole experience so much longer and more terrible.

Any advice for getting more servings of vegetables per day when you don't have a lot of time? I prefer broccoli, asparagus, and spinach (when made right) but they take a while to make so it's hard to get in a decent amount.

Maybe I should.
By eating too much. Pretty fucking simple
Ah dude you are my hero. Such awesome words. Saved for future encounters with fat acceptance.
"I get to like fit guys, but when guys I like want fit girls they are shallow bastards."
I'd say I'm a morning and a late person. I like getting up early and being very productive. I love being productive during the day but especially in the morning. Afternoons make me feel like shit if I'm not seeing friends so they can fuck right off, there's just something about afternoons I hate but as soon as the evening comes round I'm happy again and busy, busy, busy. I really should sleep 11pm-5am then nap during the afternoon but I can't due to my work schedule. If I go to the gym after about 11am I feel so lazy and don't work out as hard as I would when I get there for 7:30am.
We shouldn't we make bets. We should hope the baby makes it out okay. And even tho she did bring this upon herself I still wouldn't want her going through that pain of having a miscarriage
Woooo!
I fucking despise it when they call themselves soooo "brave" or "courageous" for posting pictures of themselves online. They act like they are civil rights activists being oppressed when they are nothing more than lonely, angry, and insecure fat fucks congregating in one large (very large) circle jerk to suck their thumbs and soothe their fee fees. Go to war and come back thin and maybe ill call you brave.
Lordy its gut is going to send him crashing to the floor.
Hopefully it is the same one. We don't need any more planets like him.
Yeah, sure, that's what the word is supposed to mean. Curvy also was supposed to mean someone with a physique like Marilyn Monroe. BBW used to mean someone who is built like Serena Williams. Now they all mean the same thing -- lumpy, with the aroma of unwiped asshole.

They have a range of motion of like 6in. They cant even lift their ham roast legs.
I have this thing I chuckle at every so often, and it's how when we see an old photo of a saloon, and the name is written in that easily identifiable style, we think how that's so classic and vintage. While at the time that was the most contemporary thing going. Same with these fat girls and their obsession with the past. Those girls back in that era were absolutely contemporary. They were the fitness girls of their day. Minus the IG pics. Fatties need to get with the times.
Don't worry. She's not happy.

Assuming a TDEE of 7000 and caloric intake of 1600 the most weight you could lose in a week would be a little under 11 pounds. Add in a generous water weight loss of even 10 pounds and you're still quite short of a 30 pound weight loss. Remember everyone math does real. A 3500 caloric defect = a pound of weight loss.
I want to see a fit girl do this so I can perve on them. Totes straight female here, not sure why this would turn me on. The fatty is turning me off. Possibly the vodka.
Target was overtaken by SJW fuckers ages ago, they actually [banned](URLFuck Target.
9/12 is actually pretty close to the ratio of overweight/obese Americans to thin ones, so yeah. It makes sense.
if i saw fat studies on a transcript i would literally laugh in the candidates face and dismiss them on the spot.If you are too stupid to recognize a scam like that in school, you dont have the wherewithal for a real job. Scurry along to tumblr, my rotund friend.
What the fuck lol
It's not just the stairs, you get out of breath just geting out of bed or waddleing to the bus.
It's a cultural thing with them and I wouldn't be surprised if the fat acceptance "movement" started there. Whenever I visit the south it's always "you should eat more" and "Are you on some kind of diet?" just because I don't load up a huge dinner plate with a bunch of shit and then go back for seconds (seriously, fucking seconds).
Any guy here who thinks they wouldnt fuck her if she offered is a god damn liar
When you get so fat your body looks like a circle. So you measure its radius (or more accurately, diameter)
The moment i tried to convince my mother to lose weight and she looked me right in the eye and said 'not right nów, looks arent something im concerned with' i was speechless. Umm, i wanted you to lose weight so you can be healthy and live longer you stupid fucking planet -.-

&gt;ah, taking the infamous "beta male" stance.Man I can almost hear the shoulder slouch.
Not necessarily. I'm in the Navy and our cag commander is not much smaller than this. He is shorter but still overweight. Seen him fly once and he has to step on the ejection seat in order to lower himself down to get in the cockpit. But whatever, Navy regulation no longer applies to you at O-6.
Starving oneself is different for long term and short term, short term is yes you will lose weight, long term is, your body goes into panic and begins to eat at the muscle and eventually you'll be skin and bones, after this point you will die, since most people with access to food wouldn't be able to get to this point, you will probably start eating before you lose muscle, at this point your body will recognize that you haven't been able to store energy (fat is stored energy) and then proceed to store most if not all of the energy you take in (food) this causes your body to fill your fat cells making them grow. Basically your body prepares for hibernation, because it thinks It will have to go without food for a long time again. Also thanks for being nice about it!:)
I like how much she mentioned food and drink. 6'5" and 300 lb is fat, no matter how she spins that. She's also fat juding by her profile picture.
Where I am, bbw stands for big black woman and she looks white to me so.
Its ok, Shitlord.
Lol so you somehow lost ten pounds in a day. Nice. And learn that " is for inches.
Reminds me of the bin of turkeys at the grocery store at Christmas.
I used to hate this place until someone on reddit showed a video where he actually uses his restaurant to show people what they are doing to themselves. Making them see that eating this massive amount of shitty food at a place that has heart attack in the name is bad for them. Sadly most for the 350+ people just see a free meal (or snack depending on their size).
That shirt is a lie. She's paying her food bill
except breath easily after a jog, amirite

So let's mock them at the gym that was specifically set up for them to exercise without having to fear mockery.Do you really think that's the best way to encourage someone? "Hey you fat fuck get off that treadmill! We all know you're just going to go home and stuff your face with shit anyway! Who do you think you're fooling? You're going to be a fat fuck for the rest of your fucking life!"Yeah I'm sure that wouldn't make someone want to give up right?
This evil obeast is happy that the animal is getting tortured. Just make you want to push it into a pit of vipers and scorpions.
haha, the cup falls over at the end of the gif
Ah, the neckbeard obeast, a very common breed of "menist" society.The common songs of this species is "all girls only like douchebags!!!! My personality matters! Asian women are docile and sweet! I will move to Japan and people will respect me there!!!!! Anyone who goes to the gym are just peasants, not smart like me!!!!!"These songs are strongest around more of its kind while partaking in Mountain Dew and whatever snacks their mom made them.
I had some fat girl threaten to kill me on the train once. Out of her slew of insults directed at me, she also called me a "skinny cunt". I'm not exactly sure why that's considered an insult.
Hoppin' on that dad bod delusion train.
I'm confused, or maybe just crazy. I don't read this as the book encouraging fat... It looks like it's a guide for overeaters that says the reason they're overeating is because of the issues they mentioned, which are in turn feminist issues. The fact that it calls itself 'a self-help guide for compulsive eaters suggests' that's a bad thing and an issue to be dealt with, no?
Plus I wanted it to be sustainable. Not some quick fix and then gain it all back.
I totally agree with you though,the probesity tags do need warnings. Things like that encourage a disgusting lifestyle that needs to be highly discouraged. But websites and other things are too worried about losing massive (heh) amounts of fatty support. And the ana tag is still working, and thinspo has changed to thinspoooo instead.
Reminds me of the Kia commercial with the hamsters.I don't get it, are either of those a desirable?
Fat people are the only people who *want* to have a disease. They look forward to the diagnosis as the validation they need for why they are living like slobs. Meanwhile, there are people who refuse to let their diseases or disabilities define them. They rage against their limitations and expectations. Kayla Montgomery. Lance Armstrong. Those people should be your inspiration. Not people like Tess Munster.
he ruined them both. he was supposed to keep himself and her in check, got lazy, hence the results.

I plan on going to medical school, so I will experience this first hand eventually.
Pink was never overweight, but I'm glad she feels better.
Yes she would. But not like a normal person. We would die of starvation. She would die of malnutrition long before she starved to death.
He probably spent that whole month catching up on all the eating and sleeping he missed when he wasn't on speed. And crying probably lots of crying.

The thing that fatties do that pisses me off most is when they cut down someone who has undoubtedly worked hard to lose weight. Fucking worthless subhuman creatures.
I had a chinese planet that spoke no english push her gut into me on a bus and grunt.Her minimoon daughter had to explain to me her mom wanted the seat.
Thats part of the fun!
Whats the last number? I know it goes chest waist then what?
Wings? Like jumbo fucking jet
The diet coke negates any negative effects of the rest of her food
You have beautiful eyes.
If they're wanting a fat princess to reflect real life in a fairytale, at least give her a magic scooter, a CPAP machine and make the evil Beetus Wizard steal one of her fat porky limbs. And the fairy queen can have a rag on a stick instead of a wand to clean her up after too many magic beans. Fucking fatties and their Disney bitching is retarded.

"future" husband? More like imaginary husband. Who would ever submit to all that shit?
That is just so wrong.
Who needs a relationship when you're so large your fat could substitute for an entirely new body.
That's what kills me about this sub. Fat people could be so fucking happy if they weren't fat! Once I went to the gym, a few months later getting looks from people just feels incredible
They mock them with respect.Here we mock them angrily!
she's still thinner than the average american woman.
Why do they always come here?
I think somewhere on Tumblr there must be the top 10 rules for pictures if you are a fatty, and somewhere on that list is "do not pose in a field - 'cow' is already suggested by your figure."
Bananas are so high in sugar, fat people shouldn't even eat those.
Wait, what? People are actually walking around in these things?
Right? You don't say that when someone purposely hurts themselves in any other way.
40? optimistic today I see
And I'm so sure that each and every one of these vapid bitches would happily hook up with a man if he lied and turned out to be an obese greasy neckbeard covered in acne
Thanks a lot!

I've seen that video and she actually makes loads of horrible but factual statements. My sister is a teacher and she's worked in 3 schools and interned in 5 for her degree. In every single one she said the teachers assumed kids would be horrible/poor/trouble kids from their names. Off topic I know but it makes me sad that's the case.
Don't worry you're not the only one.
That's a particularly good strategy for the NSFW subreddits
Hams gonna ham. They are vile and inconsiderate.

Well , idk about that but were certainly not meant to drink milk past infancy, I agree with you there. I haven't drank milk in ages and only very seldomly eat cheese.
Holy fuck! Width wise there is probably another two healthy sized people there. The girth of her ass, calves and probably front could make another 1-2 people.
I've had to trim off EIGHT FUCKING INCHES on all of my dress shirts because the waist was way too wide even though it fit on the soulders.
I don't care... I just enjoy hating on nasty fat fucks too.
Fat people hardly lurk here. They are at foodporn.
how helpful is creatine with building muscle? I've been lifting a few months and thought about picking some up...
It's a pretty simple fucking concept. Ideally, no, I will not take up more space than I need.But for women to tell me to just deal with it, is akin to me giving advice about which tampon brands work best. I have no clue about it, and they have no clue about how uncomfortable it is. Sure, I could sit with my legs together, but then what if I need to "adjust" myself? Should I just be uncomfortable for the entire ride? I feel like this will just lead to more men needing to reach down their pants to adjust the equipment, which will lead to the overly sensitive idiots behind this to the conclusion of "OMG HE'S MASTURBATING, HIS HAND IS IN HIS PANTS," even though it was just a split second.So which would you really prefer, manspreading or constant nutadjusting?
effyourbeautystandards &gt; Bones are for dogs, men like meat!OMG thin girls think they're such hot shit &gt; I'm so cute!
At least this cow has enough sense to admit it's mistake.
They wish there was a magic bean for that. Thats why i hate fat fucks, they want a nice body but are too lazy to do the work to get it
Exactly this. This is probably my biggest issue with fatties. As a European living in a country with nationalised healthcare, I find it outrageous that my tax money is used to pay for the inevitable consequences of these obeasts' shitty life decisions. Why should the part of society that makes correct, healthy choices be punished by also being burdened with the obligation to take care of the people who couldn't even be bothered to take care of themselves?If you want to eat until you resemble a small planet, then fine. But there's no way that healthy people should have to pay for the expensive healthcare that you *will* need.
Wait, those chairs aren't meant for 2 people?I legitimately thought these were mini-couches.
I KNEW she was going to say hot topic for some reason
Well. FatDucks sound cool too

I have hypothyroid. I'm also 6' and 180 lbs :) I haven't been posting here for long but figure I'll eventually get verified.
Yeah I was having a good laugh reading them too! :) Princesspeen is definitely fat lol
And honestly, this is why a lot of the shootings by cops are happening, because many aren't fit enough to apprehend a subject without using a gun. I'm surprised their sausage fingers fit in the trigger guards.
lol at shitlord restaurant trying to sneak more vegetables into fattie's diet :DD
I hate this as well, because obeasts automatically assume being skinny is miserable.Why? Just because we don't need to stuff our face with food all day doesn't mean we're miserable.
You've misunderstood the picture. All the girls here were frolicking about around the beach when this ham planet walked by. In doing so, her gravity pulled all the women to her side like bolts to a magnet.
Corporate warehouses
I use chrome and I use "Tumblr Savior" it blacklists certain tags which is awesome. You can look at things in peace without fatasses popping up all over the place - makes the site so much better...
Thank you. Happy cake day.
Nice work OP. I love the reply stop eating your doughnut
What what in the butt?
Thin privilege is not being mistaken for something out of a survival horror (or of an Innsmouth attic). I've seen some disturbing shit on FPH but this one is even weirder than usual. I can't believe how a human can turn into this without special effects makeup.
So hard to tell now, even more with the "feminists" who let their leg hair and armpits' hair grow out of control. I give up, man.

I got 30 seconds in and puked.
BMI has very high specificity. It actually tends to skew results such that you appear skinnier by BMI than you really are. For example, &gt;95% of those that BMI labeled as overweight *are* overweight by body fat percentage. However, the lowest number that I've seen in a study was that only 76% of those who were overweight by body fat percentage were labeled as overweight in BMI.For obesity it gets better, though. 97% of obese individuals by body fat percentage were marked by BMI as obese, and &gt;99% of individuals marked by BMI as obese were indeed obese. At this level, it is both highly accurate and highly specific.

Seriously. They always say 'imagine telling a smoker they have to have only one cigarette a day for the rest of their lives!' And I keep thinking, if you told a smoker that they could have like ten cigs a day and they'd never have to worry about health problems, they'd probably be happy as fuck.
Sorry, legit question here. I had a cat who died yesterday, sadly, at the age of 15. I always just filled up her bowl and she'd eat whatever she was hungry for, and leave the rest. She was always normal size, and for the past 2 years, even underweight.What makes some cats eat infinitely unless you take the bowl away, while others simply eat their share?
I saw an xpost somewhere in the default subs and had to click. This sub sure is full of *special* people but let me just say I've worked out a lot harder in the last 2 weeks after finding this place...

The gender neutral gw subs never really get too active.I think we need separate subs for shitlords and ladies. Although so far... niiiceeee.
Unless "le turtle" likes to role play the opposite gender, the text indicates its female.
Btw, being comfortable in your skin is completely different than being attractive to others. I don't know why they think they are the same.
And I'm sure when a flying fatty needs one of these, they are *tight*.

"Muh is a pretty curvy model." Then goes to reward her self with a 10 people meal.
Wow, the original photo is pretty neat. Worth suffering through the ham version to see that. It's nice when a couple can share in such a healthy way of life together
Maybe her medical condition was a unique one and she was actually made of stone? Huh?! Ever think of that you shitlord?
To be honest, I don't mind. More fat people here will result in them dying much quicker, hopefully to a point where they can't reproduce and spread bullshit like this to their children
I bet that covetous fat says awful things behind her back.
Putting the mega in megabus
Instant rage when i see this. I have completed both P90X and Insanity and have gone from average to swoll privilege. Seeing fatties like this claiming to have results makes me want to rip my hair out or get more gains.
Brave but stinky
The fuck is that thing?
Looking around at loseit, it seems like 10 pounds/month is the most common weight loss rate for obese people. So, for her it would take about 9 months...
I like it
Because these people **CAN NOT** think that far in future. They've lived their lives with the hourly hunger and so set their live's clocks by that. The food they shove in their faces provides instant relief and happiness, so they expect everything else to work that way too.
My cousin gets fatter every time I see her too. Difference is she's 27 and should know better.

6 Examples of How People Suffer From Their Social Ineptitude.
you guys realize that their pilot (if it gets aired at all) is going to be on at 3 :30 in the morning right? even popular adult swim shows only get like 300,000 viewers. at 3: 30 am, there will probably be like 20,000 people watching. plus if sam succeeds in naming it something completely random, then no one will even be able to find MDE.
Oh wow, I had no idea low fat donuts had no calories in them. Why was I not told sooner? Stupid doctors and such being wrong about the standard of health all the time :/. Sheeesh.
Why the fuck do these monsters need to get naked constantly to prove how confident they are with their bodies? The fit girls with nothing to prove, the ones with **real** confidence and self esteem don't have to show how secure and brave they are by showing everyone their entire naked body.PS: There's nothing brave about showing your "curves", we already could tell you were fat when you still had your clothes on.
Oh that's very true. Agreed.

Why did I click that? I completely regret clicking that.
Ok, this is kind of true, but not in the way they think it is.Sugar cane is actually very high in vitamins and minerals, and having a piece to chew on (sort of like gum) is not really much different than eating a piece of fruit.The problem is that the sugar is refined and concentrated from the plant, and the byproduct that's actually nutrient dense (molasses) is sold separately.It's equivalent to saying HFCS is good for you because corn is good for you, or comparing eating an orange to drinking orange juice. Basically it's the concentration that makes it unhealthy.

They'd have o find a way to enslave fit people to cater to them because who else is going to do literally EVERYTHING a society needs to survive? Loads of them can't even wipe their own asses. Or move. At all. They need fit people to run shit because otherwise the all die like upturned turtles.
I was almost ashamed at how hard I laughed at this, then I remembered it was a fat person.
Fuck brigading, but that picture (and person behind it) is fucked up! We would report pro-ana stuff, or cutting as a self harm, this weight gain will ultimatetly kill you, slowly and painfully.

Fuck you, I've seen weed addiction ruin lives too. Just because it's not as bad as other drugs doesn't mean it's not supposed to be questioned.By your same logic killing someone isn't as bad as stealing their car, does that mean we shouldn't punish car thieves?I am not wrong, at the very least we think differently, but you aren't right over me. I am sorry you get so angry talking about drugs.
Dude, I was just checking her for mines.
How tall are you?
Exactly. It's not like she needs permission from her mom to lose weight (besides she's an adult)."Mom please can I? Can I...can I stop shoving cheetos into muh mouth now pleeesh???"Uhhh, really? No one needs permission to eat less, it's like the easiest thing in the world, fats just want excuses to place the blame on other people.

So the mentality of "I am deliberately making something to contribute to their slow death" is still there...the mentality you claimed was malicious and unethical, but it is somehow okay now that fit people miss out on low-sugar cookies?OP wants fatties to die, wants to contribute to their death, and this is okay as long as fit people miss out on low-sugar cookies. Otherwise, it is fatpeople**abuse** to cater to people's tastes.

The swearing ham has only 5 words in her dictionary. That's sad.In my mind the biker and the fit girl have sex later, laughing about the hams, and maybe they end up having an happy life together, thanks to the raging hams.
When not even a construct of tension and steel can give you shape, you are too fat to care about. PS TO ANY TITPERS LURKING: a corset doesn't make you magically skinny or rebellious. The fat has to go somewhere and fat girl in a corset is obnoxious and gross at best.
Maybe a restaurant that served a range of small-large potions of relatively healthy food (nothing dripping in grease etc) and had a very strict "no fatties" policy. That way, those who really do need a large amount of food per day (such as my boyfriend, a high-performance athlete and personal trainer) can have larger portions, but nobody has to see a fatty gorge themselves as they aren't even allowed in the building.
Because it makes no sense. His rap name isn't "Freeway Rick Ross" nor does he rap about selling drugs in california. Rick Ross isn't a super uncommon name, their can be multiple people who work the same job in the same field. If your name is James Smith and you work IT at a company and there's another guy who changes his name to James Smith that doesn't mean the other James Smith is attempting to steal your likeness. Their can be multiple drug dealers named Rick Ross. I think using "Freeway Ricky Ross" would be a bit much but it doesn't even go there.Also, if you're really going to sue over likenesses, than how come you aren't after actual impersonators? Elvis, Tupac, Biggie, Obama literally anyone famous has people impersonating them. I saw a Guy Fieri impersonator once. Those are people actually attempting to profit off someone's likeness. They go around calling themselves "Elvis Presley" If you attempt to set a precedent with Rick Ross, than half of Vegas can lose their jobs to lawsuits. Did Rick Ross take his name from Freeway Ricky Ross. Yes. That being said, RR doesn't write songs from the perspective of FRR. He doesn't take things from his autobiography as his own. He raps from the perspective of a Tony Montana like character that happens to be named Rick Ross. IMO that's not impersonation. And even if you consider it to be, you should probably focus your efforts on actual impersonators pretending to be people they arent. People who buy Rick Ross albums don't buy them because they think he's FRR, they buy them because they wanna hear lavish raps about being a drug lord. Having the same name, even though he popularized it, doesn't entitle FRR any money. Now if RR was reading FRR's autobiography and stealing shit from his past than maybe so, but he's not, so it's not impersonation.
Referencing another sub is against the rules, friend. Repost without that part if you wish, though this has already been posted here.
I'm gonna step out of the hold here and disagree. Not all obese people are part of the blatantly idiotic "HAES" movement and they aren't advocating "fat acceptance" with ever jowl movement. Some just live their lives accepting that they're unhealthy and overweight but aren't motivated enough to do anything about it.
&gt; Oh and let me add, there's nothing dangerous about having your feet fall asleep. When I say over time, the damage becomes irreversible, that doesn't mean the more times your foot falls asleep, the more likely it is to kill your nerve. Oh. I feel dumb now! :p&gt; Instead, I mean that if your foot falls asleep and you let it stay asleep for days or weeks on end, eventually the nerve will die. Damn lazy foot! It sleeps for weeks at a time!Seriously though I can't even imagine.&gt; If you reestablish bloodflow and your foot wakes up, no permanent changes to your nerves have happened, and there's nothing to worry about. As long as you're not in a coma, you're not going to be able to stay in one position long enough to kill a nerve that way. And even coma patients have nurses who come and move them around a bit.Good to know! And here I thought they were just preventing bedsores. I learn so much on this sub! :D&gt; Keep in mind that diabetics typically have those parasthesia feelings in their toes for years before they go completely numb.And I'm guessing that the solution isn't to eat a dozen more doughnuts and take some insulin. No wonder these people end up losing appendages!
when i go for a run going past fatties is extra satisfying
I have several people grudgingly in my life who are over the age of 15 and don't understand that a collection of quirks and fandoms does not a personality make.You're 33, a Zelda shirt and purple pixie cut does not disguise the extra 60 pounds, and no one cares what your favorite band is after high school.
Good God. Those poor feet. Smushed flat! x_x
Lucky! I felt my first baby at about 18 weeks, and heard subsequent babies you feel earlier. I was expecting to feel my second baby around 16 weeks, but due to the anterior placenta I couldn't feel anything until 21-22 weeks. I was starting to get worried! (Not currently pregnant, baby was born last year.)
This reminds me of that episode of house where that obese girl turned out to have a tumor or something on her pituitary gland. Once it was removed she was no longer obese and was perfectly healthy. That girl worked so hard to be a normal weight but she literally couldn't. That would make me so mad.
Only seen an FA once when I travelled to the city. Obesity rate in my country is fairly low (10%). Could be lower.
My mother uses this excuse for why she eats unhealthy food and is overweight. She is aware of consumerism and what is happening, yet she still eats crap because she says "society has made her addicted to it". *Sigh.*
milk whey oatmeal spinach orange juice peanut butter
Multiple levels of disgusting.
&gt;Having the ability to warm up food by putting them in your rolls.Blaaaaaargh. I puked in my mouth.
Maybe they forgot to add *pic unrelated* Or maybe obese is the new chubby. Definition has no definition anymore.
Why do these people take and post nude or almost nude pics??
Yes!! Japan is also a great shitlord nation. I much rather living in an Asian country than in a North American one just because I don't feel like an oppressed minority.
When I realized it was frowned upon to talk about living a healthy lifestyle. I started to notice all the fatties gave me dirty looks when mentioning working out. Sorry you shove your face with food after work and I don't.

Genetics is probably my least favorite excuse. I've heard it from clients and students alike many, many times. To combat this, I've pulled up pictures on Facebook of family gatherings for comparison. My parents are not quite hamplanet status, but they could each stand to lose 40-50 pounds.
If civilization were to dissolve tomorrow and it was every-man-for-himself, I doubt being 250 lbs overweight would be an advantage.
I'm sorry to bother all you nice people but WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK DID I JUST SEE.

I haven't been to a gym in 5 years, id much rather run outside and hike. Fat people dont understand this concept. i heard this girl say she only walks on gym treadmills because jogging outside "hurts"
When you've lost all perspective on what "feeling good" means, how can you possibly know?You hear all the time about ex-fats who say they never knew it wasn't normal to have aching knees, be out-of-breath going upstairs, have trouble sleeping, etc. until they lost the weight. Fats normalize their own health problems because they can't remember when it was better. And we're supposed to trust *their* biased feelz more than we trust the work of scientists, dietitians, and doctors? Please.

Usually that's true. But honestly Keto is a good gimmick. People take it too far initially and get overexcited and treat it like magic, but it works and it removes fat people from society so I can't complain.When people simply cut out just about all carbs it makes it VERY easy to establish a healthy relationship with food, since you discover your natural satiety. And for that, I think it has a lot of value as a "Fad diet".But yeah, I don't need it anymore, so I now just pay attention to calories to maintain and protein to bulk that's about it.

I'm so cute. Someone date me? Holy shit. That is the most pathetically desperate thing I have heard all year.
I gotta disagree. Taking a super car around a track, with or without someone you're having sex with, is more fun in my eyes than sex. Sure sex can make other things more fun, but this is about things that are better on their own. I'd also count "raising a huge investment for a business you own", "winning a competition you've struggled with for months" and "making a huge sale for your company" as better than sex.
It looks like there was a very large sack of flour or butter. Then someone cut a face off someone and put it onto the sack.

They're also not a snowflake but an avalanche.
That's probably the most fucked up situation that I've ever read about. Wow.
It's reverting back to it's original form.
Most of the "shaming" they claim to endure isn't shaming at all. A store not having a huge plus sized section isn't shaming. A store not having a plus sized section at all isn't shaming. A parent/friend/doctor saying they should lose weight isn't shaming. Two people talking about their diet/exercise routine isn't shaming. Someone ordering a salad isn't shaming. In fact, I would say that most of them have never actually been shamed for their weight outside of their own heads. 99% of them have never had someone come up to them, smack the food out of their hands, and say "piggy piggy needs to diet." Here's an example: When I was in school, I got bad grades because I didn't care to do homework. At the same time, everyone I was friends with were straight A honor roll students. My mom would wait until I had my friends over, then bring my report card down and pass it around, exclaiming "I don't know how Nadaplanet's grades are so bad when she hangs out with smart people like you. I'm surprised you don't want a smarter friend. I wish she could be more like you guys." That is shaming.If a persons husband/parent waited until they had company and brought out a pair of the fatties underwear and said "Jeez guys, look at the size of these. Can you believe she wears something this big? How can she let herself get this huge?" that would be fatshaming.There's a difference between that and "doctor said I'd get diabetes if I don't lose weight, the fatshamer."
Belgium and Quebec both have obeast Ministers of Health. It could just be that French people love irony.
I feel you liebchen ;[
I would imagine those clothes are dirty, and it hasn't showered in a few days too in that case.
...because you might never find your way back out through all the fat rolls.
Well... I'm white so there is hope for me after all haha... just gotta perfect that lotion game and I'm golden!
&gt; I'm not sure where nausea came into play, I'm also not sure what you're askingIsn't morning sickness worse if your stomach is empty?
The fuck is that???
watching it right now
Gonna need a bigger pile of hay.
my mum is exactly like this. my brother is trying his hardest to lose weight, he goes to the gym each day at 6 in the morning and he is constantly mocked by our mother for it. she says things like "it's never going to work" "your brother has your dad's genes and you have mine!" "there is no control over it" the reason why I am fit and healthy is because I exercise and eat a balanced diet and do not live in the same house (which I am encouraging my brother to do the same) as my mother and her terrible eating habits.
How can you work out and get fat?
I literally cannot grow that much facial hair if I tried
A giant ass butter-fly?
No judge would sentence her to prison. Just a fine.
I feel like we should have HAMS. Health at my size. Just to fuck with the HAES hams.
I was a dancer before I was a cyclist. Looking good in Lycra is the real skill.
It looks like she does all her thinking with her stomach already
People in my extended family took that way out. 3 sisters all did it, all of them are still round shaped, because they figured out while you can't eat big meals, but you can eat A LOT of meals.
She has no muscles? I see them. I see the muscles! Abs, quads, arms. Honest mistake I guess. Fatty wouldn't know them if she saw them.
Should forearms sag?
For anyone wondering this is a new app called Yik Yak, works similar to reddit in that you post a thought and it get up or down voted and you can comment. No usernames or anything so its completely anonymous and works in a small distance radius so for me its just on campus. If you have anything funny you think I should put feel free to make suggestions
That's actually called a panis. Yep, a panis.
Upvoted, because exact same scenario here. I have only a few on my boobs because they small-ish, but my hips, goddamnit, they got hit hard. No babies yet.
Probably a good call. You'd need a forklift to get it out anyways.Edit: thought this was a reply to a different comment, lol
Hellooo [/Takei]
This. Thank you so much.
Yeah. It's from her original article, where she also comments on the three different types of reactions she got: creepy, negative and positive.The creepy ones don't bother her because:"I’m more inclined to be bothered by the terrible spelling and botched use of the English language (we aren’t in the age of T9 anymore people, there is no excuse for keyboard laziness!)"
Should have let him follow you more then siracha sauce his eyes...
I hope that ham doesn't eat that poor creature :(
His pants sag almost as low as his standards.
Put a NSFL tag, OP.
She deleted the post, there's a post referencing the deletion on getmotivated atm(currently 3)
Do they realize they look like they smell awful? Nothing sexy about that at all.
I definitely browse fitspo for abs and glute motivation, not to see people that are somewhat less huge.
How old are these girls. And seriously what the fuck??
&gt; She's probably get stretch marks in all sorts of places you can't imagine.And would never *want* to imagine! D:
Without fail pear chan's body fucking disturbs me every time. It's like someone took a stretchy garbage bag shaped like a human and stuffed it with festering cottage cheese, then dressed it up like its a human being or something.
If Jabba and Lando mated.
Personally, I'm not looking for warmth or shade from my partner... That's what blankets/heat/AC/trees are for... I got a mental image of a ham laying next to me for warmth and I think I'd rather die from hypothermia.
Get outta here with your fat logic.Banned.
Its sad when the best argument you can make for mating with you is your secondary function as a space heater.
Obviously she stole your lunch money everyday.
NSFW this... please.
Fat girl boobs are just fat rolls. They definitely don't count.
Just more evidence that your pets will love you no matter what if you're not seriously abusing them....
Ohh thanks. I reddit on reddit is fun and dont know how to show the sidebar lol.
It is both unbelievable and unimpressive.She may be able to push herself to run 1 mile at that rate, though seeing that body it is more likely she does it for 30 seconds, she would not be able to keep that rate up for an hour.
That's what fatties do... Ruin things. As in everything.
Hunchback whale.
i've been on this sub for a while now and i learned the lingo. I got all of the names we use for them except for shitlord. this is probably a very stupid question,but where does this term come from?
Can't you inject something lethal into her IV? Please?
You can't claim "Fearlessness" when you are that big. Food is your forever cushion.
He says his dick is 6 inches long and probably a few more inches are hidden within the fat.. I'm not joking. He really said this.. on a podcast a few years ago. He also said he could make a girl orgasm just from kissing.The podcast is called PKA.. I'll try and add the links later for proof. But anyone who watches that podcast can easily back me up.
Some things you just cannot unsee
Ive actually used very similar techniques online dating. State that you are crazy into ( sport which obeasts cannot do ) I use rock climbing. Say that you have a cupon for rock climbing and think it's a great first date. Always have a backup shitlordian first date incase they say they have a sprain wrist or ankle, there is always something that an injured human can do that an obeast cannot.
A couple of teaspoons of sugar per day is about 50 calories. Per week, that's 350 extra calories. So, it would take about 10 weeks to gain one pound at that rate. There are 52 weeks in a year, so that's about 5-6 pounds per year. If she was having 4 teaspoons extra per day, that's 10-12 pounds per year. Not really possible unless she's overeating in other areas.
A new kind of body dysmorphia...
Incorrect law. You're thinking of the BBFC classification act that can into power earlier this month.What /u/MixedWithFruit is correctly pointing out is the [Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008](URLSection 5 is focused on extreme pornography, in which Vore falls.
Looks like he's about 22 months along. Should go into labor soon.
I like that she and her fat baby share the same almost total lack of muscle definition.
He is a genius for knowing his market. A bunch of idiots who still pay for mu sic that specifically glorify mediocrity
I have seen those suggestions and I can't say I totally disagree with them.Putting fat people in concentration camps, they are too fucking lazy to be of any use, the poor guards will have to put up with constant whining.
And another one bites the dust.
Who is this? Anyone one have a link to google her? I've googled girl with a beluga forehead and no luck?

You think someone who hast trouble standing up from a chair can do any of these? Curls is all they can do because it resembles stuffing their face.
It looks like the result of a female Chris Farley mating with an uglier version of Chris Farley.
Oooooooohhh! The hooooog! Had to do it after I saw the toy story alien.
But food was scarce and we had to hunt for it. In some cases run our prey to exhaustion. So fuck your lame excuses and quasi-health dementia, eat a vegetable and get off the couch.
Goddammit. Why do they think that being topless = artsy ?I guess this is the only way they can make people look at them.
stop trying to make him quit

Really ? Wow. I thought fats were the first to go...
I don't think there's anything "little" about that picture.
nah
I know? I said close to underweight
Well at least since you have to shop at Pennington's or mattress mart or some shit you don't have to worry about running into him. Hahaha I just realized that you *running* anywhere isn't a possibility. My bad.
Dang. My mom was messed up if she actually had everything that she was diagnosed/claimed to be diagnosed with: fibromyalgia, lupus, copd, IBS, I don't even remember what else. She died of congestive heart failure, or congenital heart failure? I forget exactly.
Happy to oblige, m'shit.
I think anyone who's ever done leg press would know that's nothing to brag about. Not even just at that weight but 5 foot 3 yet too? There's no way this ham has ever done a leg press
Oh god I can't even imagine myself living with such a thing. I'm so sorry you have to live with it.
Aaaaand pants now soaked. :D

It's funny because it's ironic.
&gt;I have never met one person on this planet who likes big breasts, but if the woman is fat, will cease liking her breasts. Obviously she's never met me. Thank fucking god.
Hm, I'd have to disagree. Fat has nothing to do with how well muscle and connective tissue work in, say, throwing a punch--with power behind it anyway.Unless we're talking the ol' F=m*a but even so, you'd have to be some fitness there to be effective.
I love this. But how could we ever make it happen? The government will only do stuff that serves the public when the public demands it but most of the public is obese and would refute it. How to implement the theory...
Most definitely a troll. Though, there are probably some people who actually think like this.
The fat man in my platoon sat down one day and said "I'm not motivated". He was processed out the next day. I applaud his honesty but he never should have enlisted.

I'm not. I just don't want to be super swole. I'd be good with a ryan phillippe type body.
I just bought some shorts from Tommy Bahamas. Me; male, 5' 11", swolish, usually wear a 33" but a 31" fit me. The surprise was that they had shorts by waist size and by s/m/l. I tried on a med for curiosity and it fell off. So I matched it with the sized shorts - a 36" or a 38". Medium in America is fucking fat.

They do. The first edit was actually realistic waistlines (Still had the hourglass shape, just without the three-inch waist) and they looked fine. In this edit they look like hamplanets.

How would any would-be rapist even find any holes on that body? I feel like all the fat would get in the way.Maybe he would just fuck the fat rolls or something? I don't know, I'm no rapist.

I mean my vet said that bahaha but I won't question it... Better to err on the side of healthy, but it makes sense. One cat of mine is a tiny bit too little and the other is trying really fucking hard to get fat. He's currently screeching outside the door because I shut tinycat in with her can of wet food.

People like you are ruining your own movement. Op posted this article basically saying "the media wants people to think that gay people are more hated and oppressed than they actually are". Which is a fair argument even though I don't necessarily agree with it. Then you add homophobic remarks which completely counteracts the point he was trying to make. It's hilarious.

Fatass was bitching about it, so I checked this sub and I subbed here.
I feel ya. I have stretch marks on my inner thighs. I have no clue why though.
Being fit does take work. However, being not fat is pretty fucking easy.

Don't worry, bud. I'm 22, and honestly if you get shit it's subjective.Everyone ages differentially. I've met people my age that were more immature than the kids who graduated years graduated years after I did.
Thank you Professor Farnsworth.
This made me want to fucking puke. Professional environments are somewhere that should be institutionally enforced. I would wear a tie to work every day if my clients weren't prone to choking me to death with them. I can't even wear cute scarves. It's the worst. Seriously though, shoes off is not fucking okay. Unless you work at some bootleg fucking lulumon yoga business, keep your fucking shoes on.
You got remember their are fats subscribed to this place who are hiding. I want to see more verified users, that is the only way we know who the actually shitlords are.
I think the food industry really fucks people over man. The cafeterias have all that bullshit, they should have actual food. If anyone here has Netflix (lol who am I kidding?) watch "Fed Up" it was awesome. Show this fat shit the light brother so that he may go forth and conquer, go forth, and die... At an appropriate age.

Just be the best example you can. Eat as healthy as you can around him. Don’t lounge around when he can see you. Be active. Do work. And tell him you’re disappointed. Say that. Mean it. “You disappoint me. I’m ashamed to be your older brother because you are fat and don’t care about yourself.”Man, my older sister told me she was disappointed in me once. I looked up to her. It fucking broke my heart and I did everything I could to be better. She didn’t make fun of me, she didn’t yell at me. She didn’t call me names. She just said “I’m disappointed in you.” Ughhhhhh.
You shut up! She loves the gym. They have mirrors big enough for her to take a full body selfie in. Shudder.
I think it's for ab muscles
0_0, please tell me they left without unplugging the thing just to punish her.
The tits tell.Fat chick tits tend to come out really far when in skinny poses...
Just *for* the tip.
Now she has to deal with those stretchmarks. Damn shame, she dun fucked up. Another reason why you should never let yourself go in the first place.

I have a BMI of 24.5. My calipers tell me that right now my body fat is 16%. I feel fat as fuck, and even though I'm not quite as fat as I feel, I'm definitely borderline chubby. People tell me that I'm skinny all the fucking time. It blows my mind.
&gt;hope your health is improving so you can get out and enjoy the weatherAKADo some exercise you fat bitch.This woman is the queen of subtle...
I had no IDEA o.O -embarassed- lol
I'm in my 20s... but I remember a time when "curvy" meant curvy and not "look at my beautiful stretch marks!"I fucking hate how fatties have destroyed that term.
Walk through the store with a hand-basket full of veggies. Remove unhealthy foods from fatties' baskets while they yell at you. Replace with veggies. Repeat.
I hate fat people.
Yes, definitely don't settle for anything until your lawyer gives it a good look. It is also good that you are going to the doctor just as a precaution. Glad your Garda buddy is alright as well.

Yeah actually that's how it reads now. How about we correct her, because in a way all the people did it out of one thing for her. Love every single person that has ever made me feel bad for being a fat woman. Love every single person who's ever told me I wasn't attractive, or told me to take my life because I didn't deserve to breathe the same oxygen. Love every lover, friend, or family member who's ever made "caring advice" comments to me about my weight and my body expanding instead of asking if I was happy. The media for excluding fat bodies except to make us a joke on diet shows, or TLC based shows about weight loss surgery. Love all the people who live and breathe hatred for fat bodies because of their own sick insecurities. Love anyone that makes people who are fat and unhealthy feel ashamed. Love anyone that assumes being fat and unhealthy are synonyms.

That fatty fat fat has nicer shit than I do. And look at what a fucking slob she is. Toilet paper on the couch?
They will receive no hate from me - *after* I have seen them in there for 6+ months. After I have seen them go from not a single pull up to a few sets of 10 full pull ups. After the flabby guy who fails his bench press with less weight than mine (and I'm a weak ass girl right now whose bench sucks) makes it to a working weight of what he used to weigh. *Then* they will have my respect. But not a moment before. I do not believe in rewarding "effort". I will stand to recognize it, but only results deserve "reward". Do not cheapen the depth of the reward by handing it out to those who do nor earn it or deserve it.
My mistake, you are right. For some reason I thought it was jabba but that's probably because the hams all look like that

I'm allergic to salicylicates which is a lot of veggies and most fruit that isn't citrus. Leafy greens and squash seems to be ok still. And anything cooked is fine! Only raw stuff has salicylicates. It sucks though because who believes someone when they say they're allergic to salad? No one, that's who.
Caricature is exactly what I was thinking as well, her body looks spot-on like the exaggerated "overweight rural matron/wife" caricature called "Elma Kutiainen" which the late Finnish satirical cartoonist Kari Suomalainen used - massive and relatively shapeless upper body, trunk-like legs. Plus the tight dress makes me immediately think of Elma Kutiainen's underpants which made appearance few times in the cartoons. :PBut at least Elma Kutiainen was a honest farmer's wife, instead of trying to fashion herself as some kind of moral crusader and model. :D

Brings a different version of "side boob" to the table.
You are correct. Fats grow too fast horizontally and bear their skin's cry for mercy.
I was actually more or less speaking to the cultural differences between someone who lives in very rural America such as Mississippi -vs- a major city like NY. Not so much language, though as a New Yorker, if you've ever tried to understand someone from southern Louisiana speak, you're going to have a bad time. There are stark differences in terms of quality of life, exposure to people of other cultures and ideals, mannerisms, behaviors, family life, childhood experiences, and social norms. One not better or more advanced than the other. Simply different. Language aside; people living in France, Germany, Italy or Greece share quite a few cultural and behavioral similarities. They are often well traveled due to Europe's more advanced and affordable mass transit systems. They tend to have exposure to multi-cultural people and experiences. Quality of life is also fairly similar among most of the euro nations. Of course there are rural portions of Europe, similar to the U.S. But consider the level of isolation that some areas of the U.S. experience since it is huge. Whereas the major U.S. cities are melting pots similar to most of Europe. In my experience, and in my travels, [language aside] I found more similarities in the people I encounter from different euro nations than I have from state to state. Of course there are exceptions. This is just my anecdotal life experience. And I can imagine that it may even have some level of bias, since I [like anyone] may gravitate towards certain types of people I encounter. Though, I do tend to "people study" a lot more than most when I travel. It's actually the reason I like to travel so much. I enjoy meeting strangers much more than I like looking at architecture or oil on a wall. People are much more fascinating to me.
Also, first thought when I got this comment? Found the fatty, hahaha. &lt;3
God damn. If I were you I would have nightmares every single night.
Well, no, she can't. Elephants don't have knees.EDIT: correction, they do have knees, they just can't jump. Only hambeasts have completely lost their joints.
This is great advice. When people say they want to lose weight but they also want to build muscle, I encourage them think critically about how they want to look. Serious lifting adds mass and weight, albeit desirable weight. Some people are so afraid of gaining that they are afraid of gains. This seems especially true of women. Some of them are terrified of looking too muscular. To each his/her own. Some people also don't realize that lifting itself requires a dietary change to meet the demand you're putting on your body. For myself, there is no way I could be on a 2000 calorie diet. I would be miserable. My runs would be miserable.
A few weeks back, I found a girl I had a crush on in high school on Facebook. She's barely recognizable. I double checked her last name, where she lived, all of that stuff because I didn't want to think it was her. She got huge. Her face puffed out. I had to stare at her picture for a good minute before I saw any resemblance to the girl I knew. If the name had been different, there was no way you could ever convince me it was the same person.

Health issues you're not ready to talk about, huh? Someday soon she'll be posting guides to administer insulin injections. Chalk another one up to the genetics.
The weird thing is that there are plenty of thin girls with eating disorders who post under the hashtag 'fatspo' as well as 'thinspo'. Instagram is just full of shit.
That's the woman on the fat episode of the show "Taboo." She was very proud of her weight in that. Supersize vs Superskinny always shows a lard mound from America to try to scare the super sizer intolosing weight. The U.S. fatty is always sad and imploring the super sizer to lose weight before it gets worse. So if her purpose is to be wake up call, it seems pretty contradictory to what she was saying in the Taboo episode.
The Amount of fucking REKT in the response....Holy shit

Yeah that's what I meant (by no way did I want to imply that all dojos in the USA are bad, just that the comparative lack of legal regulations in that field, compared to my country, allows such establishment to exist and prosper financially).
Its the opposite. Their condishuns will create more energy from the body parts than they actually contain, leading to uncontrollable weight gain.
You look amazing :) I would kill to look like you!

I am only 30... and it was like that when I was a kid. Though to be fair, the fat kid at my school had type 1 diabetes and no one made fun of her.
The gas chambers were to rid people of typhus. The zyklon b was used to kill the lice that carried the typhus. There was never any written order by Hitler to exterminate the Jews. The nazis wrote everything down, they surely would have written that if there were. The final solution was to relocate European Jews to Madagascar. I believe any Jews that died, died as a result of typhus and the food shortages as a result of allied bombings of German supply runs.

We know you aren't fat too because no fatty could build that without having 6 heart attacks
Wait no, I was thinking rows.
No, because the majority of the fat is separate from the muscle rather than being marbled through it. Marbled fat melts as the meat cooks and makes it nice and tender. Fat fat is the piece of gristle at the edge that you trim off and give to your dog. Mobile fats may have more muscle than the average person underneath it all because they need to be strong to haul all that weight around, but the super blobs that cant even walk would be inedible.We could probably melt them down and use them to light oil lamps if the power was out, so they wouldn't be completely useless.
Whichever practice she joins, I'm staying far far away. In the theater of the shitlord mind...Consultant: "You need to lose weight to work in my department."Fatty: "'How darr yew jardj me, but ah'm, ah hahv a jenatick cuntdishin."Consultant: "You crushed a child with your FUPA. Get out of my hospital!"Fatty: Help! RAPE! PATRIARCHIEEEE!"
Good NFL linemen only play for 6-7 years because of their weight destroying their bodies. And this is a position where playing for 15-20 years used to be common. There's nothing that can be done about it because being fat and fast is a massive advantage over being fast and low mass in football in these positions.[Edit] Here's something on the topic:Here's a bit on the topic(Note all the guys dropping dead):URL
I'm loving the go as a fatty idea
The other one has a "chubby" sticker on it, it passed chubby about 200lbs ago.
Which organ.....?
The thing about her list of "healthy" is you can fake ALLLLLLL of that shit with makeup.Guess what, it turns out hams tend to wear a lot of makeup and use camera angles and filters to make themselves look as human and healthy as possible.But I bet if you proved she wasn't healthy (via doctor checkup) that she'd just default to "well HAES isn't about health! It's about muh rights to choose to be a fat pig and then use your tax dollars to pay for muh surgeries and muh beetus medicine!"BTW *no hams have "functioning, alert bodies" compared to actually fit people.*
Okay, that was terrible right from the beginning, but is somehow managed to fall apart even further starting at number 10. Like really, how stupid can you be?

Reported for fat sympathy. It's pretty fucking obvious fatties have problems.
Heels apparently made from adamantium. How are they not wedged into the floor?
..In that dream she had one time.
At her point it's pretty much being a skinny person trapped in a barrel of gluten
Pretty sure learnt is a UK thing. Still correct. Only time learnt is wrong is when it's being used as a synonym for educated.
but then they would have to face real problems
&gt;a single clapping push up so loud that the girl had to ask if he was alright because she thought he broke something.I laughed. Loudly.
I'm surprised she (he? it?) was feeling pretty good in the first place. Congrats a day without any chest pains or join aches!
I don't get it! Don't they know that is has an automatic cow/bull connotation?

When you are living in the artic and run out of oil, so you use fat to keep your lamp burning
Amazingly, I am able to eat ice cream with my kids *and* dinner with my husband and still weigh 125lbs at 5'6. I must just have special genetics or something.
fellow physics degree holder here! funny how it's almost like motivation and determination can take you places in all aspects of life....

I have eczema and so does my 70 some year old grandma who has awful health and neither of us have every had such a massive and nasty rash . She looks like she's decomposing
This mayo is trying real hard to keep its eyes open.
to be honest, I'd go fat people spelunking for a modest paycheck.. I'd rather do that than retail/hospitality work lol
Think I'm gonna unsub. They might be lard asses but as a Christain I know I should also at least treat with as a human being. You guys seem to take it to far. Peace.
I'm willing to bet it's because I looked pretty sickly, to a point where people felt moved to intervene. I've always been very ribby and noticeably thin, so that may have played into it
Happened to me once. WHEN I WAS TWELVE.
Pfft, joke's on her, I bet you look awesome in a uniform!
You beauty
They said the results would go up this coming Wednesday
It's whatever they need to say in the moment to validate being a blob of fat.

Haha. That facial expression. Looks like you're going Super Cyan.
This is obviously about the hair. Shitpost.

if she wasn't fat, she would just be ugly.
She is so hot. Actual curvy girls like this make me hate whales 10x more. Goddamn she's thick asf
My first thought was "sentiment."
Not feeling the baby kick through the piles of fat is one thing, but shouldn't the, oh I dunno, *missing your period for nine months* thing clue you in?!
devil advocate. it is a country with inhabted by the samoaen people and the samoaen always have had a tendesy to be overweight
What will you name them?
She looks like a mad scientist combined a caterpillar, a cow and a person.
"I can tell you what to do, I'm older than you."UGHHHHH
My boner is too
Most have a limit of 250. Next up is 350. The ones for 500 pounds up (the fact they have to make these that strong scares and appalls me) are huge.I just got my power wheelchair (not fat) and the guy who kept tightening the harness (I am paraplegic with MS) said it was refreshing to fit a thin person for an $8,000 chair for a change.90% of chairs, he said sadly, are for obeasts. He used the word obeasts.
Sadly, you are probably right. It is proven that being an obeast literally makes you dumber.* [New study finds obesity and brain damage are connected](URL* [Does Being Overweight Damage Your Brain?](URL* [How Being Fat Makes You Stupid](URL

Yeah, I always read through the whole message if it's something actually somewhat personalised to me, but if I don't find the person attractive I won't message back. I still do appreciate them actually writing out a proper message though. I don't even look at the ones who just write 'hey' or 'how are u'. They could be super attractive for all I know, but I'm not interested in replying to someone who can't even come up with two sentences about similar interests.
My zodiac is pig :(
It has a neck-beard, the neck-beard I mean.

Glass blowing pipe. Probably melted between her already melting folds. Blecch. Wearing a jacket while doing that equals waterfalls of sweat, especially a fat person.
Sausage fingers and her knee caps and ankles have almost been consumed by fat. Do not be deceived by this wretched hambeast.
...can our mods just ban their mods?
Eww.
What fold? lol.
"those kinds of guys"So she doesn't like people who know what they want- an active person who has their shit together and the willpower to achieve their goals instead of sit on their ass all day and get fat.
And the fact that Spaceballs is on Netflix.
I never liked Josh, nor did my sister. We both thought he was a sexist close minded dick. And to know now that he is a true weirdo makes more sense than ever. Call it women's intuition but I was on to something. I don't know if he is a sociopath considering I dated one and they barely are capable of loving someone, but if he is one I wouldn't be surprised.
there's two of these things?
Wow never knew this sub existed. Thank you!
The guy in the top picture? Moses DeWitt?
Maybe this subreddit isn't a good place for you...
last time ic checked the butt had muscles
Hey fatty don't get mad because because she's not motivated
JewTube took it down. Got a mirror?
Ride the Walrus!
holocausting me lolz
At least it's not fat.
Lolololol no. That's childish
She has a seriously punchable face.
The tapering is redundant, as the ribfest would need to climb the stairs (they wouldn't).
where the fuck can I get those glasses?
Well that obviously never happened.
Obvious HIPPO violation. /s
Now kiss.
For sure I agree with you, but just debunking a lie I see often around here, nobody can have 25+ BMI and not be fat according to most of this subreddit's users. So just trying to avoid what the fatasses do, stick to a lie because it makes us have better fee fees.
Besides it'd be envious not jealous...Regardless, what fucking subreddit would say yes to this question, does reddit have a whalefucking subreddit, like I'm pretty sure it has a dogfucking subreddit although I'm really hoping I'm making that up, but with subreddits like sexyabortions and cutefemale corpses who can guess.But according to all the butterhuffer hurt feefees it's this subreddit that should get shutdown.
Number 3 is basically from Scorates. Skinny people are free to eat junk food when they want because they don't eat junk food every time they want.

D'you not know about cubs and bears tho?
This film was absolutely amazing! I have to admit I might not actually be a nazi but I might be.. I am just fascinated by the German military of the time and I even wish I could have fought for the fatherland to bring down Ivan! After this movie I think I had a new respect for Adolf Hitler. I don't think he should have killed the Jews, maybe had them in his army, but everything else he did for Germany was fantastic. He brought Germany out from the economic ruin implemented by the Treaty of Versailles and restored the German people. The ending is very sad and it left the impression that Germans never give up.
Gross!I found a 7 month old picture and she said she has been 'maintaining' for the last 6. She has quite a bit more than 20lbs to lose.
Sportscarkin
EWWWWWWWW
I think she just hasn't ever really exercised and thinks muscle burn is a bad thing because she never experienced it before.
I think the current layout likely reflects that South Korea is more of a shame culture, while USA is more guilt-based.
Correct.
Face swap doesn't help.
Holy shit. Why do they always have that crazy look in their eyes that glares no shame in their game?
When my waist was 29" I had 40" hips. I was chubby, but not overweight in the medical sense (BMI ~23).
Wuts goin on here aye? Everyone is so "oh she will die soon" and "he won't live past 30 lol" but now everyone feels bad about this shit???? No it's not good enough your right ham enablers are a s bad and EVERYONE on this sub has agreed at some point so y all of a sudden this one is off limits?

Money can't buy a sexy body.
I tried to link a past comment that someone made in /r/news, but the automod deleted it. Apparently, it's because she has a nice body...no wait..it's because she has nice skin...This is how our conversation went (beware, it's long)**SJW/neckbeard**: People are upset when they show women distorted to unrealistic and unhealthy proportions with photoshop in advertisements promoting that as an "ideal" appearance. That's not an attractive woman. There is no woman who looks like that. That's an impossible person intended to make every woman who looks at the sign feel ugly and buy the product in a pointless attempt to achieve an unreachable ideal. This has nothing to do with encouraging people to be in shape and be healthy. This has to do with encouraging people to harm and hate themselves in an attempt to look like no woman has ever looked.**me**: I find her attractive. Plenty of women look like that naturally. Some women just have wide hips. What world do you live in where women like that don't exist?**SJW/neckbeard**:Yes, you do find her attractive, because the image has been altered to create an ideal of attractiveness to most people. Also, you have been trained by consuming altered media your entire life to think that an actual woman looks like that naked. That is not a picture of a woman. The woman that was originally a picture of does not look like that at all. There is no person in existence who looks like that. The producers of this kind of media use photo-editing software to dramatically alter every aspect of the original pictures to be inhumanly perfect. There are before/after pictures floating around that show the process from magazine advertisements similar to this. No person could ever look like that, because that's not a picture of a person.**Me:**LOL. First of all, I haven't been trained to like her body. I like healthy women. Most people like healthy women because that's how biology is. We are attracted to people that look like they can produce healthy offspring. It is because of this that most people aren't sexually attracted to 60lb anorexics or 700 obese women. Secondly, there definitely [ARE](URL**SWJ/Neckbeard**: The wide hips and thigh gap are not the part of that advertisement that are objectionable. Of course women have those. What no woman has is that level of smooth, featureless, tone skin and absolutely symmetrical features. Their torsos don't have those perfectly smooth curves with the aesthetically perfect lines and proportions. Do some women have great skin and great bodies? Absolutely. Just not that great.**Me:** Huh? Are you looking at a different ad than me? You can't tell what kind of skin she has. It's gray. Also, plenty of women have perfect skin. Have you ever been to Korea? Many of the women there have perfect skin. Could it be that she is a model BECAUSE she looks great naturally? There are women that are just naturally smoking hot. Irina Shayk is a perfect example of this. Not everyone with nice skin is airbrushed. Some people use chemical peels, microneedle rollers, sunscreen, and tretinion to get great skin. I'm not sure what you mean by "featureless" skin. Not everyone has moles and freckles. Some people that do have them get them removed (they could then use a laser or a microneedle roller to get rid of the scar)**SWJ/Neckbeard**: Oh, so you're saying that some women use chemical or medical procedures to alter their bodies to meet an unnatural ideal that without those treatments would only exist through the magic of air-brushing and photoshop. Yes, I would agree with that, and I think that's indicative of a serious problem with our ideals of beauty.**Me**: You're hilarious. Or...could it be that some people do those things because they get ingrown hairs or painful acne? Gasp! Could it be that she had a mole removed to make sure it isn't cancerous? Could it be that she takes care of her skin because it's literally her job to look good? I use chemical peels on my skin because I have KP. KP makes my skin dry and itchy. Guess what prevents dry skin from popping up? Those chemicals. Go back to Tumblr. Some girls just look good. Judging from the videos that I've seen of her on Youtube, she looks exactly the same as she does in these photos. She didn't have any moles until after she got a tan.
See? Back in the fifties stores knew how to cater to women of size and weren't ashamed of having lingerie for their larger clientele displayed out in the open. That's because thicker women were the most desired of womens. Skinny bitches were never desired in those days. It's just the media that has poisoned men over decades into thinking bones are good in bed. *huff huff*
"I've been eating broccoli all day and I'm GAINING weight! I mean, I've already eaten like 5000 calories of it, and there has been NO weight loss! Losing weight is impossible!"

Looking at him, he is more like a smaller planet or a moon. Certainly not an astronaut.
when you get out the door, place arms over your head and scream, then start running.
My bad...thought gawking at these monstrosities was OK. I'm no Ham lover.
My thoughts too.
That should be its cue that it shouldn't be that big. If your boobs don't grow to match your size (and still look like boobs) you aren't meant to be that big.
Bring me Solo and the wookie. I think that's enough of a description.
I always try to match. I go to the gym to look good, and I look good going to the gym. Am I weird
Southern Trains!!! Hello fellow home counties/London shitlord!
Also what's with the whole "big personality" thing. I think every fat person I've met/known has been largely obnoxious and loud.
Really?
First time seeing your username here. Made me laugh thinking about all the fatties i've heard call real girls that. Usually after claiming that slut shaming is so morally wrong (unless it's you, you thin privilege, beauty privilege bitch. You're obviously the slutty exception who deserves shame)
Fat bronies are the bottom of any social ladder.
If my professor came and told me honestly that I needed to study harder, I'd go home and sob. Because I AM AWARE. Of course I know I need to study more. I get reminded every day. But the road to a better education has to start with a healthy mindset. As long as I'm constantly being told that I'm failing, I'll never be able to pass.
Give into your anger. [strike me down with it](URL
Oh gross. Her legs are disgusting. How does she walk?!
Love that they tag it fathate instead of stopfurnitureabuse. Chairs have rights too, y'all.
Here's one of my responses to someone asking me to clarify my answers because I couldn't understand them. I think this works okay.I don’t see it as scatter-brained and I honestly think I followed points logically as I went. But look at that challenge I proposed: When we talk you’ll either end the conversation by saying “I don’t understand you” and leaving or “I understand you” and staying. I’m predicting the course of this conversation right now. I literally just said this in the video. I’m not mad at you and the fact that you’re trying very hard to see my point of view is better than most people try to do.So this is how humanity plays a role in this. At the beginning of civilizations, violent, less intelligent people picked up clubs and took over the world. Then people start developing culture and rules around it. Rules that kept smarter ideas out of the world. Ideas like property rights, which guarantee that people who are hard on their luck can’t afford a home in some cases. But hey at least you’re taken care of for good. It’s a bit selfish and it absolutely doesn’t fit into modern society, with all the people in it. There’s no space to go around. Which is why so many people are approaching this idea that things need to change. You see governments changing around the world to try and accommodate the needs of the people and so on. My pattern describes it. The world is trying to fight for good and intelligence there.But I’m saying our rules and labels for mental illness are all wrong. And you need to think that I might not just be “crazy” and “hard to understand” but I’m speaking the truth. So we can talk until you understand it or you say you can’t understand it and walk away.

That's a fair point, and no doubt the majority were given that it was pretty socially acceptable at the time. I should probably have been more specific, in that they were targeting a very specific form of sexual discrimination. However, many movements/individuals pertaining to specific forms of discrimination or oppression could be charged with neglecting or undermining others. Many accuse Ghandi of sexually exploiting underage girls, for example. It's pretty common knowledge that a number of the Founding Fathers were slave owners. Of course these are legitimate criticisms of said people and their achievements, but I think you may struggle to find many movements or white individuals from that time period who weren't racist to some degree. I think John Stuart Mill's criticism of Thomas Carlyle's justification of slavery comes about as close as anything I've seen.eta: I will grant you that Elizabeth Cady Stanton sucked particularly hard with respect to racism
I didn't realize it's condescending to point out how English works you uncultured fuck.
perfect. feed him water.
Yeah racists have no business here. Most of us just hate on the fatties. Most people here (you can tell by all of the nice comments on this thread), myself included, welcome *anyone* who isn't fat. So, welcome palew. :)
Didn't make it all the way through...WAAYYY TOO GROSS
Because [ham](/spoiler) and [doritos](/spoiler)

You sound like a 12-year-old girl. You have some pudge. You're otherwise reasonably human shaped.
I'm not in the US but it seems like breaking down in the middle of nowhere would be a reasonable time to make a non emergency call. I'd do it.
Cant word it better myself. As far as they are concerned, anyone not fat, have neon dyed hair, piercings, and horrible tatoos are opressing them and are racist
That made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside

Actually no. This person is hideously fat and you are talking about potential in those things that are thighs. You sound like a chubby chaser to be fair. Go back to fatlogic.
It's barely 40 out right now and I'm sitting here in my undies with the heat off, Washingtonians are like psuedoCanadians.
I've said it several times in this sub and I'll say it again. As a type 1 diabetic, this kind of shit INFURIATES ME. This cunt needs to get fucking BENT. She embraces the kind of diet and lifestyle I've lived for the last 16 years? Then SHE WOULD BE A HEALTHY WEIGHT. The ONLY excuse for developing type 2 diabetes is old fucking age, and I don't see any wrinkles on this bitch's hand, so she needs to stop being a fat cunt, move more and eat less, and quit her bullshit with this attention-whore tattoo!GOD! SO PISSED! /rant
Moderation is key. Its okay to eat unhealthy stuff as long as it isn't is huge proportions. People are fat because they have no self control and just give in to cravings.

If you get fat and someone leaves you because of it, it's 100% your fault for sabotaging your relationship by making yourself sexually unattractive.
Clearly an act.

This feels like the William Wallace speech of FPH. *Raises torch*.
I worked as a CNA for three years. They literally don't. Have shame. I mean, I've cleaned my fair share of shit, and to be honest nothing really grosses me out anymore, and I was always happy to do it for the elderly people who can't help it and aren't really aware enough to know what they're doing anyway. I mean, I did home health for awhile with a 102 year old blind man who would try to hide in the bathroom and clean himself up if he had an accident, rather than asking for help. Poor guy was so ashamed and I felt horrible for him, but I was more than happy to wipe his ass. But it's the utter lack of shame or embarrassment from morbidly obese, middle aged people who ate themselves into immobility that repulsed me the most.
She's probably already constantly flatulent. How would she even know if she suddenly got a lactose intolerance?
She's not wearing shorts wtffff
You need to outnumber them! I hate that there are so many fat fucks as well, when actually I'd love to see how x looks on attractive people. Flaunt your amazing body :)
She isn't even doing the pose right. I CANNOT stand when fatties in yoga class thinks it's ok to just be in a sports bra. YACK. Put your shirt back on.
Must be. Fellow Aussie here and first time I'm hearing it.
I wish I had the nerve to snap a pic directly of her face. It was the piggiest, meanest, most punchable face that I've ever seen outside of this sub! She emphasized LIGHT ketchup and mayo three times and asked for a regular soda, which to her meant room temp. Fucking gross.
Pray she doesn't get to be on top, then yeah you're right it's like drowning in a vat of lard.
Fair enough. As long as you're doing both, though, I think you're safe.
Actually, Mormons do consider themselves Christian. It's some other Christians who don't consider Mormons to be Christian.

Anyone that says something like "big girls do it better" has never fucked or cuddled a girl who's not just a big blob of fat.
Looks like two pigs shoved headfirst into her boots.
I almost had the opposite happen to me. Two of our cats are almost completely black so in the dark it's almost impossible to see them. One night I was at the top of the stairs just on my way down and one of them decided to run right in front of me. Had no idea he was there because it was so dark, almost tripped down the stairs.
You just gave me a Halloween costume idea. Ronald McDonald or the BK King as hitmen dealing out death to fatties.
Can confirm - am a gay; no fat chicks.
You don't even have to exercise that much if you just count calories. I lost 20 pounds over about 4 months without any real exercise regimen (I walk a good amount during the day, but for pure mobility purposes) by simply keeping my caloric intake below 2000 (my BMR is about 1900, and I'm not sedentary so I use about 2300 calories a day without intending to exercise). That was fucking easy. A 1700 calorie diet isn't hard either, just don't be a fucking pig. I guarantee if fat people ate less than 1700 calories a day and walked for just 30 minutes, basically minimal effort, they would see positive results in 2 weeks. EDIT: should note that I'm male
Just looked up what that is. Dafuq did i just watch
fatties are also pretty loose too
There's an askmen thread about preferring fatties at the top of the shitty sub atm. I know they're the lowest common denominators, but it's pretty close to 9/10... *blech*

These are the same animals that hitherto discovering said waffle stomp simply stewed in their own waste. I no longer question the extent of a hamplanet's repulsiveness; I know now it is boundless, much like their bodies.
I know but I meant the fat people who do that, if they've told myfitnesspal they're trying to lose then it shouldn't tell them to Replace them

I can't tell which picture is of the front and which picture is the back.
These are starting to sound like Bal-Sagoth lyrics. I'm loving it. If you haven't heard of them, it's symphonic (space-opera/Lovecraftian/Antedeluvian Lore) Metal. Their printed lyrics are all stories with narration and dialog with the key parts actually making it into the song, often with multipart sagas told across several albums. The word choice and narration style is very impressive from you both, reminds me of the intro to Arcana Antedeluvia, check out the lyrics online you'll probably love it. I may start writing ban stories of this nature inspired by the both of you.
Haha, oh man. I don't have the heart to tell my friend that she looks like she has a bunch of shit in her eye lashes. People want to believe the hype so badly.

She's trying to be Tess Munster. That woman should be a warning not a role model.
"I'm studying medicine" = I haven't even finished my gen ed for nursing school but I *definitely* have every intention of declaring to the school my intention to enter the program. I just haven't done it yet. So busy with my CNA clinicals, you know how it is.
You can see gut cellulite through the waistband, too. Impressive.
"What is it that all these fat people are hating?"
Don't give fatties the idea that their burger scarfing is bulking for gains.
How can that pig look at the other girls and think "yeah WE look good"
That juggalo comment... I mean... We must hate juggalo's by extension of fat right? I've never seen a difference. Anyway that's not needed. That Mysti is fucking enormous, it must be a fetishist thing.
It didn't hit me until I noticed the thumb that's pushing in the side fat is actually engulfed in a fat roll. Took a minute for my fat detective skills to kick in but either way she has a very odd look. There's definitely someone getting catfished with this picture.
Oh yes ... many thanks!
Thanks :')
Ive been shitlording on cracked for about a year. Way before i found fph. If you say one negative thing about fatties you get thumbs down into oblivion

Don't worry about assholes berating you for shit like this. Simply tell them to back the fuck off, you eat sensibly, you maintain a nice physique and love your body for how it is - i.e fucking awesome. Let them stay jealous of the fact you look and feel better than them.
Is it avoidable, or just bad luck in shooting the wrong animal?

Don't do it!
Lol yes. The planet animal horders who starve their pets ate the most infuriating. FEED. YOUR. ANIMALS. PROPERLY. See also, doomsday preppers. You can't survive off the grid, you're hardly alive on the grid.
She wants you to believe it though.
merchandising done right
I guess all the women saying they like the dad bod is annoying as hell to me. Although I guess I'd be interested in the celebrities who say they like it and the people they actually date.
I didn't mean literally as I don't self diagnose but if there is something you'd like to share please do. I meant I was specific about where kept my batteries charge percentage. If I'm wrong about that or there is something else you have been upset by please let me know
honestly impressive that she can jump rope like that without liquefying every bone below her waist. you can tell she has been at this for a little while, but she must reward herself with a large pizza or 2 every time she goes to the gym.
can she fucking breath sitting like that?
i like it. good phone background
There's a symptom called 'PhotoShop'. A quite common disease. Usually male patients' biceps are swollen, and female patients curves are curvier, sometimes even exaggerated as in this case.
Is she trying to photobomb your selfie or does she always look like that 0.0pretty hairs, btw.
Calories count for your weight, but what you eat most definitely influenced your health
Shit. Now how are we going to keep it in the pasture with the rest of them?
Well, I am violence-kin and I find your aversion to violence very, very triggering.
Guess they have those breaded deep fried chicken salads?
It's not black and white. I'm not asking for people to be nice. I'm looking for a different class of post. It's got nothing to do with obeasts, it the talent of the user base to entertain that I'm complaining about. Eg. when a fatty posts "if you can't handle me I assume you don't have the correct equipment." the correct reply in my eyes is "yeah, I don't have a forklift" not "you're a fuckwit".I want more forklift less looking like a 12 year old on xbox live.
They see the distant lands in a far more truthful light than we dom
I'd be careful. Hams might actually think they look like the thinner version. Maybe add a note that says something along the lines of; 'What could've been?' or 'If you put down the fork', ect. ?
Yeah there's no way that guy got that many tinder dates. I might be bitter tho
Thank fuck not all feminists are the same, I always feel happy when I see a man or woman out there helping whoever needs it, not who has the same type of genitals.
Bazinga! Honestly, no it isn't.
My wife is 5'7" and we'd be having a very serious talk if she got to 160.
I guess part of the problem is that all her friends tell her that she's hot and she's unaware just how fat she is.
That guy is praying for graduation...
Enjoyed the weather with a good run in the neighbourhood. Meanwhile this land whale enjoyed it blobbing around on grass.
Many reasons.* First, because fattery is *so goddamned prevalent.* It is an epidemic.* Second, because it is preventable. It is obviously not something like leukemia that is not chosen.* Third, because there are fucking assholes trying to normalize it. People trying to convince themselves and others that fat is healthy or attractive.In comparison, legbeards and various angry, stinky armpit hippies are nearly as disgusting, but they are much fewer in number, and there is no organized propaganda campaign to normalize them. Fats are a much bigger problem, so I aim my fury at them first. But I am subbed to things that criticize SRS and tumblr, too. The normalization of hideousness, whether via fat or via armpit hair or via delusional genders, is all of one piece - the twisted desire to achieve some sort of revenge on the world by inflicting one's most disgusting self upon it.
Eeeeeew
I didn't get auto-registered with the private ones after I verified either. I'd guess you have to ask :)
Is that a .....stahp sign??
Yeah, not exactly the smartest thing to tell a cop. Lol. It's been so many years since I touched that stuff, I probably would act like a fruitcake. And forget driving. I just want to hide in a closet until it's over. Learned early that wasn't for me! Haha.
2L of Pepsi = 845 calories , and that is only the drink, in one setting! and they wonder why they get fat.
Holy chinsac. Looks like a frog (sorry frogs.)
Eh, I've seen lots of skinny people with weirdly fat faces, on the other hand she has a punchable face
This is pretty funny. These writers have a decent sense of humor, whether they know it or not. I remember walking by the TV once when one of these generic crime shows was on and I heard: "It looks like it's a combinatorial pointer tree encryption algorithm.""Can you get in?""Yeah, I just broke it."The aftermath is just as good; the internet scholars (mostly women and some feminized hipster men) with BAs in journalism or english write about how it wasn't "nuanced and compelling" enough, e.g. URLI guess watching it "ironically for 'laughs'" is just as bad, but at least there's a degree of honesty in it. Or, at least you can pretend to be distant and cool about it, and get upvotes on alt-right forums (not this place) and pretend it's just a character. I guess you're [cover up for first person] a piece of shit too.
Thanks :)
As a general rule it's 100 extra first trimester, 300 extra second trimester, and 500 extra third trimester. But those are all at the *end* of the respective time periods; 500 is literally the MOST extra you'll need throughout all of pregnancy.
"Gimme attenshun for something I haven't even done!"Fatty wants instant gratification? How surprising.
FA is the dietary equivalent of the anti-vax movement. Let's all get together and make uneducated claims denying time tested observations
Right there with you, I'm 6'8", &lt;200, I could gain a whole bunch and still not be at "normal" weight.
Think how many mixed green salads you could buy with that! We could even use a different dressing every day of the week! And we could get Paul Newman's and have the money go back into charity.
Rake and *perfume*??
Wait, it doesn't? That's what I read. Maybe my eyes suck.
Lol. Unwilling.Putting images of yourself on the internet means you are willing to let them be used.
Can we start a new subreddit just of fat people breaking shit? Lol
So she stepped in the bottom rail, then the top? So when did she "vault"? My understanding was that vaulting required some time air borne, not climbing over the railing and striking a much dynamic pose while doing so
If that corset gets any tighter, her hamfolds will get compressed enough to form a black hole.
As a masseur for the American swimsuit bikini team?
Ohmygod, will they shut up about being "healthy" because they have good blood pressure and low cholesterol?? This argument drives me insane. You have good blood results *because you're young*, not because you're healthy. If you keep it up, in a few years your organs won't be able to continue functioning at the high capacity they are now.Y'know what, any fatties lurking here won't understand this (because it's real, not feels). So fatties, just keep it up. Sure, you're plenty healthy. Get back to us in 5 years when you have diabetes and need a scooter. Fat is totes good 4 you.
Über obvious if you don't weigh over 200 pre pregnancy. I can never tell with fatasses.
Eye bleach! I need fucking eye bleach!
Who, me?
His sugahs got low. IF he had another tray he could get to da train
Here's the thing though. Women are supposed to draw attention to themselves because as the fairer sex they are just naturally programmed to present themselves well, and men to observe and to then pursue them. I don't mean to sound sexist but men chase and women make themselves attractive as possible to be chased.So this butter chuffer here has the cute kitty top, red highlights in her hair, tattoos, feminerd glasses and the "look at me I'm so fun and bubbly with an outrageous personality unlike all those boring skinny girls" stupid smile smeared on her face. So she's presenting herself as best she can.The problem is, when your a lardpit nothing looks good on you because nothing about you looks good. No amount of hair coloring, fattoos, kitty tops, feminist bullshit accessories or shit eating sorry I mean cake eating grins can make you look good because everything about being fat looks bad and drawing attention to your rolls with accessories only makes you look uglier. Even worse it makes good clothes and pretty things look ugly because there attached to your fat ass.Pro tip: fatties. If your fat don't draw attention to it, hide in the shadows (given your radius that will be hard) because we don't want to see you and whaterever that loud, big, bubbly, happy, fun or whatever fucking fat logic bullshit your spewing about what the "cute tee hee" smile or look on you face is supposed to be well I've got bad news for you.Its none of the above, you need to over compensate for the lack or male attention you get because your so hideous by creating the loud, funny and free persona but its not. Your obnoxious and annoying.Just fuck right off, come back, and fucking fuck right off again.
No "/or" needed
It's definitely not healthy for women to be at a low bf. You don't have to be literally starving to have an eating disorder or body image issue.
You may have tried this already, but look into a brand of iron called Ferrochel. It is iron bisglycinate and very well tolerated in most people.

That mentality is the result of even allowing people to get pass 300 pounds. The government been feeding these lazy fucks for years and that encouraged more lazy fat fucks who have no will power to give up as well. That and the rising average weight for Americans redefined what it means to be "fat". The standard is so low that someone is considered at a normal weight as long as they are not morbidly obese.
Tshirts like that immediately help me know who to not even waste my time on being neutral with. I don't actively shitlord most of the time because they're not even worth the effort, but people like that? They deserve to be treated like shit. Your shirt isn't funny, and if I wore one that said I beat obesity, I'd be fucking mobbed and lynched.
I have one doughnut each Friday and then feel bad about it. Days like that I park as far from my building as possible and go a few flights of stairs on my lunch.
I'm 45 with 14%bf and i just do 4 hours at the gym a week and eat good, I'm not doing any more work than I ever have before.

Now you're banned. How precious!
I've seen fat guys with boobs and fat girls with beards, they all meet in a hazy mess in the middle
Exactly! And I've seen a couple people commenting things like "Oh well it doesn't happen often there are way more white people posted" It doesn't really make a difference. When I see racist shit on the front page or racist shit with a decent amount of upvotes it really makes me question if I should be here.
Yes. Let the hate flow through you.
It's called a mindless typo you cunt.I'm on my phone and at work.How can you not see the very basic point I'm making. Men are naturally external, penetrating creatures. From warfare to space travel, its what we do and involved in most of our accomplishments. This isn't even psychology it's anthropology.

There may be some truth to that, or not, but do you honestly think the body can estimate even roughly how much sugar it's gotten from a liquid? Most people have some sugars in their diet anyway, but claiming that diet soda's going to make you crave for more sugars sounds mostly like fat logic.
She lost her slight of ham privilege about 75 pounds ago
Question though... I used to be on tinder until I found my gf about a year and something ago. I could only message/get messaged when there was a match... Why the fuck do so many of you have butter gollums on your tinder that message you? I couldnt stand to swipe right even if it would just be to shitlord... yuck.
For a second I thought that was a grill and she was planning on cooking and eating herself.
Canadian here as well. Yup I know that smell. Used to live near a pig farm. Awful smell. Awful.
TBF, if they had any idea of what looks good, they wouldn't be fat.
Fatty needs braces ... Diet plan!
Fucking AMEN.
Had brutal reality kick up the arse when I was hospitalised with strangulated hernia. Being nearly 300 lbs..ugh..I was uncomfortable, in pain, a annoying pest to the sweet caring nurses. I needed help with everty thing, and not once did I hear a complaint from them. This was enough for me, I had to take responsibility for my own fat body.Since the operation I have halved my body weight. So please nurses, dont give up on us fatties. Some of us need this wake up call
as a hooper I have no idea how you would coordinate that
Thanks. This excites the shitlady.
Where did this girls death happen? I live in central texas
Cousin, do you want to go bowling!?
You don't care why they're fat or if their condischun is real, you hate them bc they're disgusting and near you.Hearing short guys whine about how it isn't fair that women don't want to bang them is just as annoying as listening to fat logic. Women won't be magically attracted to you because you complain, if anything, it'll make it worse. Own your shortness, be a cool person, and find someone who doesn't care. End of story.
All Day I Dream About Snacks
Hey, this is out of line. *She just died*, y'all. Show some respect.
did you really just read my comment or you didn't cause your fatty fingers just wanted to click reply?i wonder why do fatties fail so much at logic. If you are fat, you are fat, therefore, hated. Doesn't matter deathfat or smallfat.if fat = 1 then hate = 1if fat = 0 then hate = 0not to hard to get if your fucking brain wasn't choked by fat like you, stupid fatty.some mod can pls ban, i thought no fats were allowed
That's just it. HAES and Fat Acceptance are stupid for this exact reason. They just don't want to work for it, so they pretend like they're proud of who they are when really they're just stuck and setting and putting on a facade. Unfortunately for them, just about everyone else can see through it.
I wish you were my friend. You are an all around cool person.
...and by extension, not have to **shit in the shower and stomp the crap down the drain**.
I mean who would get defensive and be afraid of verifying unless they are fat...? Smells fishy.
Why do fat asses have pink skin?
dat cankle. Big bitches with little bags always make me chuckle.
That's actually brilliant, I have a few tenants on SSI for seemingly no other reason than that they are fat as fuck. I mean, if you are legitimately injured and unable to work you should still have the right to have a roof over your head and food to eat, but these assholes are just getting free money because they're fat and lazy. Ugh.
don't worry, the ham and her hamily will burn in hell!!

Yup, opening this whilst enjoying my eggs and cheese wasn't one of my smartest ideas.
It's everything to be honest. I can pinpoint the jump it all came together on for my back. It had been hurting, but one put it to the whole "yeah you're done" limit. The knees is defiantly the running plus a few bad landings. I run heel-toe, so that fucked my back up even more after 200000000000 miles a week. That life just breaks people.
Disgusting. This is why we can't have nice things....
I just keep tapping the green heart while doing something else and then filter through later.
what are tamarillos? baby tamarinds?
I would totally hit that... mmm dem tats.
It hits you funny when you see someone in here that you know personally. She is a great person, has a nice bf, and is nice, but she wasn't always fat. I've seen old pictures, when she looked good, and had a great smile and figure, but it's so sad to see that gone now. As bad as I feel for her being here, I kinda hope she sees it, and realizes how she is messing up her future because of her weight.
When I read "body talk", I think gross obese orgy.

Right? I keep trying to tell her that she's not some 7' tall Amazonian woman, she's a slightly taller than average girl who would look just fine at 140-130lbs, depending on how muscular she was. She'd be nowhere near "too skinny." She always goes on and on about how she has such broad shoulders like her dad, and it's hard not to slap her and be like "your shoulders are fat, not broad. You don't have muscular man shoulders, you have girl shoulders covered in lard."
I refuse to believe "otherkin" and tumblr's definition of gender are a grown up version of anything.
Probably a 10 footer by the looks of it!
I suffer from autism from diagnosed at a very early age. It made my social life a living hell at elementary school middle school and the first half of high school. I was sad most of the time, but unlike other autistic fat fucks, i didnt eat myself to death and judge attractive people on the internet. I went out and tried running, baseball, and other activities. Most of the fatties that use mental illness, let themselves be defined by it, and feel that they are somehow exempt from criticism because they have one (even if most of them are self diagnosed). I already have one strike against me with autism, im not gonna add fat to my already long list of flaws. It is the least i can do.
If someone posted a direct link and people started going over there to comment and downvote. You aren't allowed to bring in your own personal army to rape and pillage the populace.

*kid walks up and knocks on door. Door opens* "TRICK OR TREAA... oh, never mind." *Kid drops head and walks away slowly, disappointed. *
it's an understandable faux pas. far better than staying fat. just don't expect too many pats on the back here. look at it this way, nobody here congratulates BP for cleaning up their oil spill.i do find former hams can often be the best shitlords. so now i tell you this:&gt; verify and go into all the world and shitlord to all creation. Whoever believes and is verified will be saved, but whoever believes fatlogic will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: they will cast out butter-demons; they will eat in new moderation; they will pick up large weights with their hands; and when they drink Whey protein, it will empower them; they will place their hands on new lifters, and they will get swoll.
Underwhere.
They do get positive feedback but they should only get is shame and ridicule. I never understand these people. I'm fit and I never post pictures in my workout clothes.
I resent that...
Lol at 5.Owns her own business? Yep, a business completely dedicated to nothing else but making drawings stroking her own ego, and bragging about how fat she is. I bet the cash just pours in like gravy down her gullet.

Bring your own low calorie, healthy snacks like baby carrots or apples. Eat those instead of whatever is in the "snack closet."
To be fair, ladders (Done properly) are a brutal workout. We used to do those at the boxing gym where for 5 minutes you race down as fast as you can, do ten pushups, then sprint back. Rest for 2 minutes, repeat. God damn it felt good at the end of the day.Sorry, what were we talking about? Seeing the ladder drill made me all nostalgic for the boxing gym.

Uuuuuggggghhhh I had a friend a few years back who INSISTED that she was going to lose weight by this program and then pulled the "I have big boobs so cant exercise" card... over. and over. and over. and over.
I went to a show a few weeks ago and this fat guy in front of me kept trying to act cool. He kept getting knocked back by the pit into me too.
I'm eating while watching this and the food is starting to taste worse and worse.I gotta stop browsing FPH while eating

Meanwhile, I'm maintaining a good weight (in my opinion, but hey! I'm eating, damnit.), keeping up my GPA, and going to an ivy league school next year.Fuck you Natalie. Fuck you so hard. I cannot *wait* until our reunion. Oh my Jesus.

Maybe her lack of impulse control and poor understanding of logic is the root cause of both her obesity and her stupidity.
Of course her first insult involves eating...why the fuck wouldn't it.
It's a man, and he's got a wife 7 years younger than him so she's been dealing with all this since her early 30s. I guess it's possible that the initial heart attack wasn't directly caused by obesity, and that the inactivity/depression that resulted caused him to gain weight. But then 90% of heart attacks are thought to be caused by "lifestyle factors".
Stupidity. Racism and obesity are both linked to it.

"Hey could you give me your attractive friend's number?"
As bad as it may sound, I totally agree. I'm no super model, but at a very toned 130 lbs, I take pride in my appearance. It's no cake walk, it takes daily cardio/resistance training and a carefully planned diet. With all the work I put into my appearance and weight, I definitely feel it is my right to take pride in my body and show it off now and then! Looking healthy and toned in a tiny bikini or clingy dress is the best reward for my hard work, and if these landwhales don't like it it's their fault for being jealous!
Aside from the simple argument against, which is killing one person to save five is still a fucked up thing to do. It's like negotiating with terrorists.

She has gotten huge but i still recognized her. I look the same. We both just pretended to not know each other despite our food ordering interaction. I could feel her embarrassment, It was fucked up man. I just dont get why someone lets this shit happen. That was a weird fucking interaction.
Well there's a mood killer.
Ditto. I've also had a tumblrina inform me that being bisexual was just as bad as being "cis" because that means I'm not leaving room for trans people or people who identify as another gender. All of the facepalm.
I feel sufficiently chastised. Have mercy on us here, though, because we're shitlording as hard as we can.
Fluff.
...like 400 pounds of chewed up bubblegum./dryheave
Great, thank you!
"I do my exercises &amp; I eat what I eat &amp; do what makes me happy."  "Lemme think this over... over some **sweet tea and a cheese burger**"  Gee, I wonder what the fucking problem is.
0/10 trolling lardbeast. You should read through my comment history and get a taste for my life. Facts not feels. Also, my four favorite words, "Fuck off fatty, banned."
That actually kinda looks like he might have liver failure (ascites)...
We're probably thinking of different things, but I wouldn't mind seeing it swing on a rope either.URL
Thin privilege is having the ability to pull multiple expressions
I think I love you. You fucking *smoked* that fatty sympathizer.
Christ on a bike, is there no end to the bullshit these fuckwits will come out with?
And I would be an Olympic lifter if I could squat 500 kg. Seriously.Warning for finding something in fatties attractive.
I just about died when i read it- the rabidness, the snarling lashout. Whoa...we got a fedora here.

Not trying to diminish your situation at all, because it's pretty tragic so I hope this doesn't come off the wrong way but the sad reality is that a lot of people are doing this my friend just got diagnosed with diabetes, one of her parents died from diabetes as she wouldn't eat healthier or follow the doc's instructions and my friend is heading the same way as she can't seem to stop eating junk food
&gt;People dont do that because dumbasses like you threaten us and stalk us. Go choke on a piece of cake and keel over already."We don't do that because dumbasses threaten us so to prove I'm better than you I'm going to tell you to go choke and die."The idiocy is strong with this one.
URLFirst link, there was 968,000 more... This one is focused specifically on the elderly, not the transition into becoming elderly but I'll dig up a few when I get home and edit the post. I'm not saying you're at risk of not being able to get off the toilet. I'm saying you're at a greater risk than I am or than most individuals that are following a proper resistance training program. You seem like the guy that's not invited to the party in the first place so we won't have to worry about running into each other.
I imagine it wheezes and grunts all throughout class.
Yes the intestines can herniate into the abdominal area, this can kill them. Of higher risk would be the fat on the stomach and chest causing too much pressure on the lungs and heart from laying on their back and causing cardiac arrest.
When my oldest was about 3 or 4, we were at her daycare center. The director was a land orca and my daughter leaned over to me and advised me very loudly that "Marfa is a fatty". I about died laughing, but Martha was not amused.
Swift justice.Like the fat-shaming Batman.
Found the fatty!
Tell that to her. I wasn't kidding.

There's already one. I can't remember the name of it (although it was to the point like Attractive People or whatever) but I found it a few years ago. You have to submit a photo and other users vote on it. If you get rejected you can't create an account or view other accounts. You have to have a nice face too though.
It even has a blow hole.
I'm never going to understand why they fucking do that. You have eyes, I assume they're functional. You looked at this picture before you uploaded it. You saw what a ridiculous fucking hambeast you were, you saw the discrepancy between the picture on the costume packaging and your ugly lard dumpster body, and you posted it anyway. Fucking... WHY?
Did he actually say that, or is it just a meme?
*Fat privilege is being able to fit a Tiger gangbang on your arm*
Don't forget, you're the bitter angry one for calling them fat.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.....subscribed.
Sorry, I'm not buying it. There is no way she can spread those hog-sized bags of lard far enough apart for a clean drop. I'm thinking she just has constant skidmarks.
Shes listening to my mom on that which is something like "if someone likes you, they like you weather you are 350 kg or 50kg!" Which has made her become a total tumblrina fatty and saying that boys have to like her for who she is and she doesnt have to change herself. lol
Well...They can't get that fucking fat if they didn't have full blown fatlogic.
That ladies and gentleman is the first sight of an extra terrestrial life. Aliens who live among us believing they look like real *humans*.Rest assured, they are not and will never be humans in our eyes.
Are you from the US? This sounds like something that could only happen there.
I like to think that Tony Perkis went to jail, changed his name, and opened Globo Gym with his father's money when he got out of jail. In both movies he mentions that he has a rich father. Both movies he talks about how he used to be fat. Both movies he is insane. He is basically the same character.
Its fucking horrid how these cows gather on the internet to encourage each other to be fat. If they were all in hiding posting there fat hamplanet selves on the internet would still be shamefull and they would feel bad and wouldnt do it. It grosses me the fuck out. GO BACK INTO HIDING YOU FILTHY COWS
The same reason that people who believe in Creationism and don't believe in Global Warming ignore science... it serves their own self-delusion.
i watched all of that
Its a lonely battle on tumblr shaming fat activists. Join the ranks. There are shitloads of those morons. We need more people reblogging and spreading the anti-hambeast message. Fat Acceptance is the fucking dumbest thing I have ever heard
Milk is coming out my nose, and I wasn't drinking any milk.
&gt; Yea, as a black personNothing more annoyingly arrogant than to fashion oneself a representative of an entire race.&gt; banned*benned*.
Plus it allows them to say they joined a gym.
Well yeah, that's what I meant in the first place. I don't make expect him to pay for anything past the first or second date.
Good God, that last one! The horror!
Save the ones that can be saved. And hopefully the rest die before procreation.

&gt; I don't believe anyone who is unhygienic to be fit- regardless.I'd agree with this. Nasty skinny people then.
Give a dog an unlimited supply of food, and it will die of over eating. They don't know when to stop. Fat fucks are the same way, they aren't even human enough to know when to stop eating. Because they aren't human, can we hunt them for sportl
a shank wouldn't even penetrate the layer of fat
The point of the sub is that attention whores need validation.
That's so gross.
Holy fuck number 4. Could it look anymore like an actual ham instead of an instaham? Hello Jabba's minions!
Yeah I absolutely love REAL coffee. I'll take mine with nonfat milk - I honestly don't even like frappuccinos. They leave a really gross film on the tongue and you can't even taste the coffee. Do not recommend
If we're operating on the premise that he existed, then his popular history is often that of a stonemason. If we aren't, then there's no point in continuing this discussion.Also, I saw your ninja edit from Aristotle.
I wish there were a way to judge cases individually for who needs financial assistance and who doesn't.Fat? No, fuck you, get off your ass and work.Injured or ill? I'm happy to pay a little bit more in my share of taxes so you can live a reasonably comfortable life.
Low dose poison.
Awright! Shitlords helping eachother out! The video was morbid. I feel so sorry for that fireman, you just know he's going to catch some heat (pun not intended) for that whole situation in addittion to having to cope with someone slipping from his grip and falling to their death.I just hope he realizes that this was not his fault. That obeast would have died stuck to her sofa anyway.

That's not what she looks like at all. Where are the folds? The stretch marks? Not a single cottage cheese wrinkle. If you're going to advocate body positivity, don't photoshop the fuck out of your hideous body. Show the world what it's really like being a fucking glob. Disgusting.
The last months were very stressful for us, but his weight gain started about a year ago. I asked if anything was wrong, if he was depressed, but he always answered that he is stressed (so am I), but that he is happy. I will try to find out if anything happened a year ago that I am not currently aware of. Thank you for this take on it all!
No kidding. OKC sub is just filled with the "everyone wins" mentality. Those twats have no problem telling each other that a casual message they received sounds a bit stalker-like, making fun of people for their unflattering profile, or recounting the horrible first date they had with someone that wasn't actually that bad, but the second you mention that someone might have more success by not being fat... well... just shows why the majority of that sub needs help deceiving people into going out with them.

Dem bobs!
Now they've gone and ruined the word bombshell.
There's "go eat a sandwich" and "I need more food!"
Fuck being nice or polite. That beast doesn't deserve it. If I ever saw or heard that I would be so enraged. Your next sentence to her should be"You know what I hate worse than fat cunts like you? Fat fucking cunts who make fun of others. You are obviously so fat you're disabled, how dare you make fun of someone else much less even consider being a Teacher when you can't even teach yourself rudimentary manners or eating habits!"
Sure he can! He just has to take the cart with him. It **is** on wheels.If he has to go beyond the edge of the parking lot though he's fucked.
There's a lotta desperate guys out there.
Found it waaay down in my youtube history. :)URLThe actual quote is, "Now a tip, when you're full, is, sit up straight, deep breath, count to ten, and start again.""But why do you want to eat more if you're full?""Well I never know that I'm full."Unclear is how she knows to sit up straight and make more room if she doesn't realize she's full.

With lips that puffy, you'd think the amount of ice cream she probably eats would take down some of the swelling.Oh well, law of diminishing returns strikes again.
I'm going there soon! I'm so excited. I hope to even spot some fat American tourists so I can laugh when everything's too small for them.
I'm 6'0 tall and 175lbs, and PlanB worked for me. Same with oral contraceptives. I think it has to do with fat content as well as size since hormones especially are fat soluble. All dosages are weight dependent but the fat plays a big role for some. IP injections in mice, or even tail vein injections will show the substance accumulated in the fat if they are obese. It's pretty gross to imagine that happening in a person.
I thought we weren't allowed to post to other subs?

It seems they are only downvoting my new posts and posts they come across on those subs, which makes me think they looked over my post history once and now get angry every time they come across one of my posts. It seems really petty.
I wouldn't doubt they eat all of that fruit.... With whipped cream and angel food cake

Oh God that sounds awful. I remember having to take some non-science course(s) before the school would permit me to graduate (despite having more than enough credit hours) some horseshit about being "rounded". Fuck. I took a native american history course &amp; concentrated on NW coastal tribes. I did enjoy what I learned, (on my own, with no thanks to the instructor, who was very similar to your lazy butter golem)
Try it with pepper and lemon juice. I was sitting here scratching my head about why seasoning would be considered unhealthy and then I realized they're not talking about putting garlic powder and paprika on their chicken, they're talking about butter and bread crumbs and frying in oil.
It is so blubbersome it even made the little girl cry. Is that *skin* that is being flashed? Shouldn't Moby at least try to fasten its covering?
did she? honestly, I can't tell
&gt;Bet she could be tall and gorgeous if she put the fork down.We get the "she's be cute if she wasn't fat" posts a lot. It's a slightly positive thing to say about a fat person, and we don't want them here in the sub.
If you're looking for a serious answer, it has to be because there are IT jobs for which you can complete school online and work from home, right? At 500lbs, a "traditional" college education or job are practical impossibilities.
So do all the SJW subs get shutdown under the weight ^^teehee of self-hate they have? Seems only fair.

OK, I just returned from grocery shopping. I live in the northern US where it is winter for about 8 months of the year. Consequently, I can assure you that all of the fruit and vegetables I bought were imported from other parts of the US or from abroad.

She sounds 13, but looks 60. What is her real age?
This is an old thread but I had to have my thyroid removed completely at age 15 due to Hashimoto's. It grew a tumor and caused hyperthyroidism. In the years following I've been up, down (hypo, as she's claiming), and all around as far as my T numbers go, but I have never been overweight in my life. It's really, really not that difficult to maintain a healthy weight with thyroid disorder.
Not to nit-pick, but how was that a TKO if it wasn't even a KO? Is it because she bled?

That's not a fucking compliment. Do you realize *why* we call you that? The fact that you have your *own* gravitational pull is not something you should be happy about. Disgusting hams... **FFS.**
Basic economics though. The reason why no one actually turned in a blank test was that the incentive to cheat was too high; if you knew everyone else's was blank, by answering even one question you'd have a solid grade ahead of the class.Similarly for beasts, you'll never convince every woman to get fat (thank god) because it's too easy to look even better by being a regular human shape.
Sonny, you're a great Rugby player! Stick to that, please! Haha.
Her face is flawless though
Thought the same. So dumb they took it from the fat fetish flag..why would you do that? Isn't that like a Jewish person trying to use a nazi symbol? I mean really..
Oh, don't get me wrong. I wouldn't describe it as malicious. I think the companies simply wanted the food pyramid as a marketing tool, and they had no way of knowing what the consequences would be.

She accepted my request to follow so I'm doing the most subtle shitlording ever. So subtle that it looks like a compliment until you actually think for two seconds.

Why is her face still fat.
And she's like Naw wtf where's the rest of it and the three sides of chips and mashed taters and punkin pie! I just read that back to myself in Eric Cartmans voice, appropriate.
Why would someone pretend to have a bad pair of headphones?
Ah look, she wears portable eating utensils on her fingers.
You're absolutely right. "Fat" is not intrinsically an insult - it is merely the medical term for the way you fucked up your body. We can objectively use it to refer to you, it's tangible fact.So why are you so insulted?
Fucking sausage fingers man..
This is me:URL
Basically. Actually moving your tongue is excruciating.
im in. i want to make shitlord friends and go laugh at fatties in public. how to make an account?

They dress like old people because they know they are going to die soon.
I just had a flashing image in my head of a normal sized girl dance-running in front of a landwhale dangling coupons and yogurt in front of her, while the fatty huffs and screams "give me muh yowgurts". Thanks for that, I snort-laughed.

Uh so I'm all for hating on obnoxious fat people here and irl when they try to impose their HAES BS on everyone. But why go and start a conversation with a hammie just to harass them? Pretty low imho...
Your friend is a true friend even to that hambeast - he spoke the truth (which is possibly lifesaving)

++good just seems to fit.
Sounds like a realistic case of hyperthyroidism, which when I've met people who *actually* have it, usually motivated them to work hard at being healthy.
Only marry a fellow committed shitlord. It's really the only way. And women aren't the only ones that can fall to the post-marriage fatness. Men will let themselves go as well. So, everyone who cares needs to stick with shitlords (and then raise little shitlords).

While i understand that even skinny girls with huge breasts have sag issues, no breasts should sag below your elbows
That shit is fucking crazy! Props to you for doing such righteous work, but it must be so goddamn frustrating working with chronic girthquakes. I feel your pain, just about every ham that I've met will complain about some external factor that prevents them from losing weight. The solution: deal with it or don't be fat in the first place.I don't think I've ever eaten four pies in one sitting, ever, not even when I'm bulking.Don't let the hams get you down!
Dissapointed that's not a real subreddit.
Well, but you have to admit that the beard fits to his face.The problem with this guy is his attitude, not his beard.
Absolutely disgusting - someone should throw her some tarp! Cover that thing up!
It's one slice per person... that's ok!
Holy shitlords. There's no ending to her face. It just continues to melt down the rest of her body.
They probably had to let her out because of fupa stink, which she tries to cover up by smoking.
While on the one hand I think it's totally alright for mods to decide which people are allowed to comment in the respective subs, I don't think what they are doing is alright.There should be an option to choose which of your comments are visible in your profile.
That has GOT to be a photoshop. That head does not go with that body!

Of course, it's easy to let oneself go when you start university, a new busy job or begin raising a family. Your routine changes drastically and you don't have all the time in the world to work out, swim, go for a jog, etc. You just don't. And after long days and commutes, you don't feel like doing anything.Same happened to me every time I changed some work routine. I'll notice my jeans are getting a bit snug and I realize I've fallen into some daily pattern that is adding on the pounds, maybe the meals at the cafeteria are too heavy, or I keep grabbing a croissant for breakfast. Then I realize I have to change that. My vice for stress was smoking - for many years. It was damn hard to find something to replace that stress reliever for me but I managed to kick the habit and don't want to go back (also it's really expensive now!)I don't understand how people let themselves get to this point either, but it's some kind of coping strategy. Yes it becomes "a way of life" but I can't wrap my head around how people (especially these women) want to "embrace" it.

She's making sure her kid has curves so she will grow up and be a real woman!!
Controversial, but I find it hard to hate fatties who are good to their pets, i.e. look after them without making the pet a fat shit too.
Are you serious? She's definitely very fat and it shows in her face.
I get pretty paranoid when I smoke weed, I couldn't imagine doing it at this size and not have the full gravity of my weight situation come crashing down on me.
Koh Tao, Koh Samet some of these islands offer super cheap, less crowded and more authentic touch to thailand.. less fat people because of the remoteness and time consuming to go to.
People should just stop looking to the fashion industry to make them feel good about themselves. It's a business. They are here to make money. If they want self affirming bullshit, then they should just read Chicken Soup for the Fatty's Soul. I've read all of that tumblr speak and I'm not even sure why they are upset.
I'm curious to know what the area (sq inches) of her skin is compared to a normal woman. Those tattoos are all fucking HUGE yet they look small on her.
There is actually very little wrong with cream. It is a "good fat" , part of a group of fats which you actually should be ingesting on a daily basis!Source; i make up my last minute macros with cream.
If that's true, then I ain't even mad. That's amazing.
Thanks :). I never knew people thought it was good until I just started randomly writing stupid little stories after the mods ban a ham.
Why is she always wearing a hoodie?
Yeah, he said he loves her and thinks the problems are just temporary, since they only started after they moved in together. Come freaking on. This is who she really is.

Slay the pig! Take its head!
Wtf is going on here?! That's nasty!
If all you are is a mom, if all you have is motherhood to offer your kid, then you aren't...can't be a good mom. It takes passion.It takes an interest, a talent, a hobby, an ambition, fucking something to give your life purpose. Life outside of the child. Otherwise, you have nothing to teach. Nothing to pass on.
The lack of comments is somewhat made up for by the massive number of thumbs down. It seems her other videos still allow for comments but I'm sure that will change in a day or two.
I end up having to do exactly that where I live (Maine). I live in a coastal tourist town and we get lots of southerners on the beaches. They walk in the dune grass, not realizing that they are probably crushing the nests of the endangered piping plover. They pick up tide pool animals and toss them about. They pull up seaweed and kill the starfish and sea urchins. They scrape sponge off rocks and crush the mollusks for fun. 99% of the people who do this are the fat children of fat uncaring parents. Like, educate your damn children about respecting marine ecology and leaving no trace! They are destroying real, endangered animals. It makes me sick. There's a few of us locals who kind of mill about on the beaches in summer yelling at stupid idiot tourists.
Yes. Is there a problem here?
Not surprised to see bacon.
Not sure, don't give a fuck. All I care about is that they felt humiliating shame and that we destroyed any last vestige of self worth they were deluding themselves with.
I've got a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry's with 1080 kcal that I'm going to destroy the day finals are over.I'm fairly certain I will not wake up the next day weighing 1000 pounds.
Nice, a fellow marching band geek! :) Yeah, I guess it is possible but it just seems unlikely. Lots of people are posting that it is possible so I stand corrected!
No wonder they think it doesn't matter what you eat. Green=healthy and liquids don't have calories.
The subreddit is fatpeoplehate not funnyfatpeople.
The best I can do is butter-fried, garlic-coated pork steak (which is fucking delicious but not exactly a piece of culinary art). I only recently discovered that I like beef steak. I'd never had a properly cooked steak before; my mom always demanded they all be cooked to where there was no pink left. I finally had a medium-cooked one from a restaurant (courtesy of a friend) and HOLY FLYING FUCK I LOVE STEAK!!! I finally see what I was missing out on for so long! I'm practically drooling just thinking about how fucking amazing that steak was....
The struggle is real... Disgusting.
I can't find the words to accurately describe what I'm looking at.
I was trying to parody their delusions. But I'm guessing you got that.

"We Need New Names" It's an interesting book we are reading in class.
I hate H &amp; M. That don't carry anything under a size 0. Last time I went in there everything was way too big.
You'd have to make it explicitly clear what "fat" really is or make sure you bet with the right people because I'm sure you'll get "He/She isn't fat! Just chubby!"
Dragging down the honored name of Rossetti. What a cunt.
She probably paid some poor soul to do it for her.
I thought you were just being clever.. No one would've known.
Right now healthy normal weight people are already the minority in the US right?

It was a video going around with the song "Wrecking ball" playing. Sorry for the potato quality but it just pissed me off so I pulled screen caps. Fatty wanted to be one of the cool adults and ended up causing a back up because it was too fat to climb. Then because physics and "condishuns" about murders the poor kids.
No worries. I came and upvoted everything.
Indian here. Can confirm.Hate fat people.
*Nothing* will make her cute, save for losing weight.
I know, but out of their products, I prefer the liquid one to the paper one.
BLEGH what a piggy piggy.
Mods Mods Mods. Ban that fat asshole please.
Ok, so not only does she eat both her share of the food and part of his, but then she makes him puke at work and he loses even more food. Has she no mercy?
Years of living with men has taught me how to hold my breath for a really long time. I can get in, drop trow, pee, up pants, wash hands, and duck and roll outta there before needing to gasp for sweet, sweet air.
Agreed. There's a point however where obesity stops being pathetic and just becomes comical. Moobman achieved that.
Go be fat somewhere else.
You win.
There always seems to be some form of this garbage trending somewhere. Why don't they try to get eating healthy and exercising trending in real life? That would require effort and not include chocolate or a drive thru so I guess that is out.
Your post is like an itch in the back of my brain. The hotness, the kink, the swearing, your confidence. Where are the girls lile you not on the internet?
She's not sexy.She's not confident.She gives plenty of fucks.It's all a giant facade. Deep inside, she's horrified with herself. Guaran-fucking-teed.
Dude....soda is literally a diuretic....Have they even tried water before? Like, drinking it in its pure form? Turns out, the urinary tract cleanses itself every time you pee...so peeling is actually a really good thing...Are they constantly monitoring a critical reactor? If not, I'm not sure why an extra three minutes a day peeing is worth dying over....
I was actually talking about [this](URL
You know how dumb shit dogs are always trying to get into the kitty litter. Those people were probably envious of that free buffet.
Sorry man. I really have to disagree with your first point. Once your dead, fat or thin, your past transgressions don't matter anymore (unless you're Hitler or something). When you're dealing with cadavers, respect has a different meaning. It doesn't mean you respect decisions they made in life, it means you respect the tradition around death by leaving people to their mourning without causing undue sorrow. Respect for the dead is something society has in common with our ancestors thousands of years ago. It's the reason we dress them up and put on a macabre show instead of grinding them up and dumping them in the garden as fertilizer (something that has been suggested for future Mars colonists, btw).You don't need to start magically liking them because they're dead. Just leave them be.
41% of these statistics are believable
Ah yes, the old "Maybe if I wear this giant, raggedy old button-up shirt over my tshirt, they'll never notice that I'm morbidly obese!"
I have a lot of Facebook "friends" who post their sweaty, post Beachbody workout selfies. It's gross. Xbox has a bunch of free "workout" video program things and I found one by Beachbody so I gave it a rip. My heart rate never once elevated, I maybe glowed a bit but never actually sweated and I felt like a major loser doing all the stupid moves. Plus, it was only 30 minutes. I work up more of a sweat playing 'Just Dance' on the kinect with my 6 year old. I'll stick to my hiking and trail running thanks.
Recovering ham here, I was fat for a long time because I could always find convenient excuses and because honestly, some guy would always be willing to fuck me so I thought I must not be that bad. This was the shit that decorated my delusional brain. Plus, feminists telling me that it wasn't MY fault guys didn't find me attractive, it was THEIR fault for being close minded. Thank god someone pointed out a lot of my cognitive dissonance. I dropped feminism, became egalitarian and am working on being my own damn hero.
Poor scales, it isn't their fault, it's that damn oppressive and fat hating gravity. Its been keeping fatties down since the dawn of time. Let's petition Obama to ban gravity!
&gt; assuming the kid was smushed against the opposite side of her chair. Pretty sure s/he was.And the kid didn't say anything because s/he was terrified of the angry mean glaring fat lady who looked at him/her like she needed a snack!
If he went back for a third serving of broccoli he'd be fine. Of course the HFCS made him fat, it's calorie dense and nutritionally sparse.
They sure as hell try, though!
I'm 6'2 and can't do this because my knee is too high up when foot is flat. I think it's more correct thigh vs torso length privilege
That's actually exactly where he went hahaha
"Don't tell me (my weight) unless I ask"? WTF? Fatties, make up your goddamn minds. Are you proud of your obesity, or not?
I'd give you gold for this, but I'm poor.
Lmao
Notice the sign saying that between 1 am and 6 am you need to call for handicap access to the elevator. I wonder if she would call for help or use the stairs?
I refuse to believe this is the same person. No no no ... plz...
Is it just me or does her hairline look like shes had implants?
YESSSS. YOU ARE THE BOSS OF CAKES
Me and my SO were watching TLC and we also saw a commercial for something along the lines of My Big Fat Happy Life were it sounded basically like an FA show right after My 600lb Life and she didn't understand why it pissed me off.

Look at the comment on Imgur from the fat fuck, goodness knows what he eats for lunch, probably considers the stolen lunch to be a light snack.
Neck? I only see a stump
I love this post but feel obligated to point out from experience that someone being a shitlord does not mean that someone is good in bed, it just means there is a higher likelihood of them being good in bed.

Not sure how to define that, but he specifically said no real spoilers, and I feel like I got spoiled.

Holy shit, I didn't even notice that. Well, I guess this land whale doesn't walk, so she doesn't need legs, right?Fuck, that is disgusting. Imagine the pain when she "walks" from bathroom to the fridge.

I knew Suzy Berhow (Mort3mer) would let herself go.
I get that you were trying but honestly it's stupid and overused. There's actually a fair amount of lesbian shitlords in this sub. Unfortunately most lesbians are overweight so the stereotype is true. Still though, I just dislike the "joke".
What a fat entitled jackass. You are beautiful because you are human shaped. :).
Eww eww eww.
Best post I've ever seen here, bravo!
because they are all retards
They do live in Kentucky....just sayin
For every health problem they have they find something different to blame for. With this logic your fat doesn't show unhealthy symptoms. All illness would be thanks to some shitlord in white, or society, boing, chair manufacturers, shoe manufacturers, outlets, door manufacturers, car manufacturers, academia, science (especially stem)... See?

How do you handle exercising with fatigue? I find that's the hardest part for me. rrms here. Good on you for making the change.
The beneficial qualities scorecard according to this picture is:Skinny: 3Lardass: 1And that is if you even consider fat boobs to be boobs. Which normal humans should not.
hahah, hanging right next to Apollo 11 return vehicle and the Wright brothers plane.School children will stare up in awe as the guide tells them that back in 2014 this once held the worlds fattest schoolboy for nearly 10 minutes without breaking. Some of the kids will roll their eyes in disbelief, quietly checking the web through their i-mplant even though they are supposed to have it suspended during the tour, surreptitiously packaging this post and its comments into a 'wtf-blast' to send to his mates in the class, some of them laugh straight away, the more cautious ones laugh half a second or so later after their anti-meme software checks and approves the upload.
♫ You want this baby boy's hole, you gotta pay the troll toll... ♫Edit: No Sunny fans here, huh?
Yes. I believe it's once a week. They also do bagels.
Since they all suck at cardio, biking and walking. You never see hams on trails. Theres also some cool spots me and my friends like to hang at that can only be reached via extended bike rides/walks so I'm sure to get away from any hamplanets. Also most of us probably take this for granted but in the event you get some unwanted attention you can easily get away by outpacing them without breaking a sweat.
I love putting weights into "equivalents of me"s. Over 200 it's hard for me to imagine how much weight that really is
I had this picture open and my girlfriend walked into the room and first thing she said was why did she buy such a small belt, her fat ass needs construction straps

This person is utilizing a psychological defense mechanism against rejection from more sexually desirable mates, e.c., they're pretending that they're not attracted to people who rejected them. I think this is the situation for most chubby chasers.
Compromise by agreeing to put a bar over a couple of it's chins :p
Honestly, I don't think I can agree with this simply because of how camera shy I was myself. I'm sure there are lots of skinny, unverified users here who simply don't want to throw up a picture of themselves to be judged. Then there are those who aren't as active as the rules define. Everyone here is pretty much innocent until proven guilty. It's kind of a waste of brain power to always be so suspicious of others.
Bet she can't return to a standing position from that
Well... damn. That everything...And cue the salty hams!
It's simple just be human . Don't be a disgusting fatty.
Of all of that the "hunny" is what makes me hope this bitch choke on something.It's "honey" GET IT RIGHT, FATASS.
It was like watching a toddler throwing a fit. Also love 'hamifesto'.
I was kind of surprised it didn't tip over, they must have used some strong anchors.
Agreed. I want us to get a shitlord tumblr and start posting these types of pics with their body love tags. If they can "love" their bodies openly why can't we?
Well, it's apparent you need to be educated about it. "Offensive" speech aka anything that hurts "muh feels" is not protected in the UK, it is in America. The UK took American political correctness and went insane with it.
Not really, Houston is a booming
All that can be applied to obesity and food. Even if you have a "good reason" for doing shitty things to yourself, they were still your choices, and choosing to not lump yourself in with people who also made shitty choices is just an excuse. I've done shitty things to my body, I had a really serious self harm addiction, but I'm not here defending it. It's a shit thing to do, and while i may have had to deal with horrific things, it isn't an excuse for me to get riled up when someone says self harm is bad. Of course it's bad, drugs are bad, alcohol is bad, excess food is too bad. And if you feel the need to defend your choices then you are just as bad as tumbelrinas. Drop the attitude, dude.
I was guessing the doctor was trying damn hard not to laugh.
Shes so disgusting. When you get dealt a bad hand like that you sure as hell better make up for it with personality and improve yourself the best you can. I cant see that happening any time soon though.
Fat2fit implies that you actually get fit at some point. Like, I'm happy for you for losing the equivalent of an entire person and all, but you're still a fat fuck and I don't like you.But I feel like the posts truly started going downhill when everyone made it a point to say the following at the beginning of every post: "Be me, 5'1" 350 lb but lost 2 lb so far! Just finished up eating a salad and going for a walk on my lunch break because I'm soooo good!" Like, I don't give a shit. Come back when you're not disgusting.
This.
Kagome, what happened to you!

Mtf ts are hot. I've always liked androgynous faces more than "feminine" faces. There are plenty of people that don't care that you have a penis.
&gt;Yeah, I was pretty much trolling.Aww, poor baby. Did the mean internet guy ban you? Didn't you know the "But I'm right!" argument is retarded? Poor thing, no one told you.
That funny, because I consider other people telling me what I will and will not eat, and telling me the reasons for why I will or will not eat them to be douchey and condescending.
They have no excuses. The only veggies I eat are the occasional pickles like once a month. I'm thin as fuck.
I like bed the story about the whale coworker who was only going to eat healthy snacks from now on...so it are cheesecake for breakfast.
True that. Now, we need to shame more fatties.
Not even that, I think both groops tend not to shitlord in mixed company.
"Officer, he's gotta my purse!Please, do something!""Stop or I'm gonna roll on you!"Sorry, it's obvious, I know. But... Yeah.
god that was awful.
You won't regret it. Amazing show
I'm naturally a US 0 and can never find my size. I always have to shop online or just have things altered because stores don't order enough small sizes.
I agree. Oh the staff just loves him! Bull fucking shit.
Why do fat people think responses like that are okay? It has as little to do with her questions as possible. Not everything needs to be about food, lardass.
I went to the dollar store yesterday to pick up some cleaning supplies. While I was there, I decided to pick up a cheap t-shirt. I'm a size small but I wanted to get a 2XL-3XL shirt because I use them as PJ's. I went into the plus size area. Literally EVERY SINGLE shirt has an obnoxious phrase on it like: "You can't handle me" or "Sexy and I know it" or "I'm dressed and out of bed, what more do you want from me?" or "Bitch and proud!". Let me tell you, when I was in the regular sized isle, there was maybe one obnoxious shirt surrounded by normal clothing. So now I'm beginning to think that fat people are encouraged to be abrasive, loud and bitchy. Why is this ok!? I don't care what size you are, you don't have a license to be a bitch!I finally decided on a shirt that said something I found to be the least ridiculous in the plus sized section. It says "This is not the life I picked!" I chose that one because it seems ironic that it's printed on a 2XL t-shirt.
Scooby dooby dooo!
I have thought about this. There is a hipster couple I am friends with on Facebook, she's got the pixie cut with half her head shaved, poses as rosie the riveter, etc. He's got the macklemore haircut, wearing skinny jeans on his skinny legs, but wears flannel and has a big bushy beard. they are straight out of TiA. Is he trying to cling to his masculinity with that?
2 burgers and a large fries is not much ngl i could eat that pretty easily if i was hungry.
Day 85: Hams still want it. Send help in the form of normal women before I'm eaten. My harpoon supply is running low...
Who?
This one poster got told she was anorexic because she was limiting herself to 1,200 calories a day. Somebody else said that if two people were identical, except in fatness, that any sane person would pick the skinny variant, and there was dissent.The topics are usually great, but not so much the comments....
"I haven't lost a single pound and I can't figure out why!"
Maybe just a cynical one.
Bingo.
The verse she quotes even said that! "So Cosmo says you're fat/well I ain't down with that/cuz YOUR WAIST IS SMALL and YOUR CURVES ARE KICKIN. Are they dumb?Oh wait.
He's hiding for his life?
I like how a suggested cause is malnutrition. They eat so much more than they should but don't even manage to meet their suggested intake of minerals, vitamins or even protein.
Garbage.
She's lost a substantial amount of weight over the last two years, but "well I'm a size 6 in pants, and a s/m in shirts!" Is her rebuttal to people still calling her fat.
Ironic, cornstarch is kind of what causes the problem in the first place...
That's definitely A&amp;W
Most of them aren't even really nurses. They're LPNs or aides. The ones with less education seem to be much more interested in making sure everyone knows that "they're a nurse."
When I started at my last job I got shown around by the office ham. Took me around showing me all the ways to avoid stairs. Dude would take the elevator down one level when it was right next to an escalator.
That's a real bitch.
Oh my god I've been trying to find her too! It'd be so rich to have her ugly face on my feed next to all these gym tips.
I don't understand these hams who don't shave under their arms but still pluck their eyebrows. Keep effing those beauty standards, you hippocritical losers.
No one here cares about their fee fees.
Yep. And she's probably not as fat as a lot of them.
And maybe a hammock for that gut.

Pizza is the shit; all you have to do is find a good joint. I usually order a large thin- crust, whole wheat pie from my local family- run place, eat two slices and freeze the rest. Et voilà - emergency pizza stash, which is much tastier, healthier, *and* delivered faster than Pizza Hut's!
You really want to be egalitarian. Feminists are just hypocritical most of the time, claiming to be oppressed, and then turning around and saying how they think men should be put in camps or even killed.
Yeah you only have one life, so spend it well rather than being an obnoxious unhealthy fat fuck
They are microwaved ambrosia. Just let them cool a bit before biting into them...
Wow...thats pretty fucked up. Im going to unsubscribe I think. Making fun of dead people is actually pretty shitty (especially when the body is barely cold).Getting your jollies to people who just fucking died is on a whole new level of crazy then poking fun at fatties. Like that is some seriously awful shit. Cya
Welp, time to have an alt account.

well, from what i read, jews have more diabetes since they are disproportionately wealthier than others in that area. they WERE marginalised - however since christians cannot handle money and left it to the jews, of course the jews going to get rich.
I'm trying to imagine which would be worse: watching her trying to attempt a posting trot or watching her flob around in a sitting trot...!?

I called a woman at a local store a whale, to her face. Does that count as sitting behind a computer?

She's so fat she ran out of space in her body to put it and it ended up on her forehead.
Just look at my massive bulge and shut up.
Definitely couldn't Shake those burgers off.
Yeah, I mean I personally think Tess Munster has a beautiful face, like very very pretty. But she completely ruined that by weighing as much as a dump truck.
Watch closely and you'll probably see gravy dribbling out of her mouth in no time.
Can't believe fatty has a mate
It sure looks like she's on her lunch break behind a hotel or something and not on a "hike" as she's wearing uniform and jeans. She's still fat and yet she eats grilled cheese.
Absolutely an example of poe's law. I refuse to believe otherwise. The very first line gives it away.
There have actually been studies done which show that people tend to rate their own partner higher than independant objective observers rate them.
This fucking piece of shit probably outweighs the poor horse.
Ugh, such a childish response
I refuse to accept that as a human being. That is so wrong and disgusting it shouldn't be allowed to live. Not because it is just a blob, but because it became unable to live without the help of others due to it's own actions. It's basically a parasite litterally feasting at the expense of society and other peoples life.
&gt;"do more by trying to understand this and figure out how it works" than by "telling people to exercise and eat less."So how else can you "help" fat people? According to these "studies", some people are destined to be fat. If it is inevitable for some people to be fat, what is the point of "helping" them? Obesity is already considered a disability and fat people get money from the government. I just don't know what else do these people want?
Lmfao.

My fingers always been my terrible complex. I have very thin but also quite short fingers. I love women hand with long fingers, ill never have them BUT i still have definition of my joints, knuckles, veins and wrists! Fatties make everything so much better ^°^
And the steps, those poor steps
Bust out the semantics everyone! He's going petty!
Yeah, I'm guessing the OP might have had a learning disability or wasn't emotionally mature, which is pretty common for little kids that age. Where I grew up there were a couple of kids who would be held back between the years of kindergarten and maybe like 2nd grade, to ensure the child would have enough time to emotionally develop and have a better chance at succeeding later on. I mean, it wasn't common by any means but maybe like 1 or 2 percent of the kids had that happen.
Hey shitlord! Obesity is never related to food. I eat 300 calories a day and exercise at the gym for 2 hours every day and I'm still obese! Explain that huh huh huh!
It may not be illegal, but it makes for a damn fine case of making them pay unemployment for you :P Milk it for all you can just to make a point. Then get off your ass and get a good job not working for a fatasfuck. ymmv
" u sound poor, how dare you talk to me"This made me angry beyond beliefThe biggest choosing beggar. Literally now fatties are trying to get rich successful men. You know whats funny? As a thing broke college student, i had more shitlords like me than i have with fatties, they see me and know i cant possibly subsidize their eating habits. Self deluded fucks. Maybe because shitlords don't expect the entire world to take care of them and cater to their needs.
If you look at the amount of upvotes some of these posts get regularly compared to other subreddits similar in size its no surprise FPH is so active.

A statement that if you get enough people to feel sorry for you and post enough filtered and photoshopped (to look SMALLER!!!)selfies that you're 'changing' the industry. Such fucking bullshit.
&gt;That's because FatPeopleHate isn't the place to educate you"It's not my job to educate you shitlord!"&gt;curiously and arbitrarily biased against.Posting facts doesn't make me biased just because they make you uncomfortable. Implying that I'm a homophobe does nothing to advance your position, and your long-winded deflection only indicates that you have no evidence to back up the claims that you have posited. &gt;That's why I told you that you can go to a different sub to talk about this. This is not the place. We talk about plenty of stuff unrelated to hating fat people in this subreddit (nutrition, fitness), and you do too. You are simply attempting to silence a viewpoint that you disagree with, with a thinly veiled threat to wield your moderation power in order to ensure that your biased version of reality receives favorable exposure in this subreddit.

They also don't seem to realize that her moderating there is just a huge joke for something like this to happen.
She 'gives no fucks' - shocker. It is obvious you give no fucks, about your health, about your looks (except the hair and make up obviously she very much gives a fuck about that), about your son having a strong and healthy mother, about your arms, need I go on?

I should date a nice guy like him instead of a meathead jock asshole, amirite?
This is genius because if they take you up on it and are actually a ham, you can just run away from them.
Same here. Seeing someone so fat they need a scooter is like seeing a unicorn here in Santa Barbara. Well, more like a hippo with a horn, but whatever.
/r/guessthatgender I think I link to this sub a lot, but Christ this is a tricky one!
Is the distribution of pets uniform over weight classes though? I'm not sure that 69 % of pets belong to overweight owners. I'm willing to bet that pet owners are slightly more active than average, thus meaning that they are more likely not to be overweight.
I'm sorry Protein World that you have to put up with authorities pandering to fat, lazy, slovenly sacks of shit. There is absolutely nothing wrong with your advertisements. Look all over any other type of media and what will you find? People who are in shape, in bikinis, asking the same question; "Are you beach body ready?" This is a sad day for the world, when entitlement and laziness trump hard work and sacrifice and knowing your goddamn place. Fatties just need to go back to their trough and shut the fuck up. (This last sentence, that's fat shaming, nothing Protein World has done has been fat shaming)
This is really helpful, thank you. I think I will complain, even if nothing really comes of it.
You think people would act decent and respect other people's property. Then again hams are not people.
Jaba is sporting a shiny new hat
My stomach turned for a second before realising it wasn't fat.
I know you're joking, but I don't think the "I know more than my doctor" mentality is as strong in Canada as in the US. I had never heard any of this anti-doctor propoganda until I discovered Tumblr lol. I'm sure it exists here as well, but not as prevalent. I feel like (only speaking from my own experiences and observing people around me), that the problem here is more one of apathy, we take health and health care completely fot granted because it's free (well, not technically bc of taxes, but you know what I mean). I never miss a dentist or optometrist appointment because they always prebook and call to remind me because they want my money.... I went 7 years without seeing my doctor because I never get sick so I never thought about going, and they are not calling to get you in. I feel like a lot of fat Canadians do that as well, don't go to the doctor for years and finally go when they have an obesity related health problem and they "had no idea it had gotten that bad"....I hope that makes sense lol I'm kind of rambling now I think... anyway, the point is, with universal health care there is no reason Canada's obesity should be rising like it is, other than the fact that people are just not going to their doctor... or in tons of cases, don't have a family doctor and have to go to the walk in clinic or emerge when their sick, and the doctors there only care about treating the immediate condition, not chronic ones...
They know it won't do jack shit, that's why they have no problem with displaying this text on the bags (I guess it's a bag, a container of some sort anyway)You can't stop a pachyderm from overeating. A heart attack might, and that's stll a 'might'.
Give em another few months they'll keel over.
The thing that pisses me off about that show is how the Super Skinny people are like 1-2 BMI points underweight. They should have a show where the Super Fats are 1-2 points over. Really drive home the point that the Super Fats are so far beyond the realm of people, that they are now something totally different.
the floor is broken down into about 10 apartments with 4 bedrooms in each. 1 kitchen an 1.5 baths per apartment
Which still makes them far more trustworthy than the hams who spout HAES nonsense
You should have put the TTL;DR at the top. Baudrillard makes a lot of sense when you put it that way.
That one guy with the hammer, kept trying but couldn't hit it over 1300... He wasn't strong enough for her.Well I don't like girls that can't do more than 50 sit ups and 20 pushups. And at least run a few miles with me. But yet I'm the fucking crazy one.
"I'm looking for a relationship not for hookups"THEN GET THE FUCK OFF OF TINDER. Go join PoF or OKC or some other dating service that isn't completely based on superficial image.
I remember this. The video is pathetically hysterical. The language used is very careful, to give the impression they are crossing america, but really they are just including people *across* America.It's a "virtual journey" that was promoted on a fat forum of 1500 people. They say it "spanned 2,800 miles". Yeah. That's the distance of the width of the country, NOT how far they went.I especially love the evidence they present of their journey. They say they walked, swam, cycled and danced across America. Surely if this happened, there would be a grand pictorial account of it? Instead we get a pic of a fatty walking her dog, a fatty STANDING in a small pool, a fatty STANDING next to a bicycle, and the cherry on the cake, Ragen's "professional" dancing photo.[Here's](URL
that fupa... without pants it probably bounces off her knees when she walks!Wait a minute... i forgot, it don't walk.
Yeah but.. it should still be number one. Because.. fats ya know
I have not heard of that. It is hilarious though. I'm actually chuckling at the thought of a fatty or anyone really, 'needing' to keep eating.
And whining about "fat acceptance issues."
You cant cheat and eat that much, at this point you have to make it your lifestyle.
He probably ate it.
For awhile when I was going on a lot of dates I would always say on the first one, "if you ever get fat, the deals off".
Yeah, no denying that!I've rocked a beard for the last 8ish(?) years but I've got two little spots at the corners of my mouth where the beard meets the moustache where nothing grows. Fortunately I learned early on that having a moustache drives me crazy, so it stays shaved and the barren spots are never noticed! That said I've also seen some pretty patchy looking beards that couldn't be explained too.
Sure, but none of what you mentioned involves legal issues. School policy issues, definitely, but not legal issues. Syllabi have no legal power or authority.
Banned.
There was this super fat ass in my networking class that loudly proclaimed that he knew everything already and should be exempt from the mandatory attendance. Then threw a fit because the professor didn't do a rest break halfway through the class so he could smoke. Fucker failed the first test and struggled the rest of the semester.
That's one of the most unattractive faces I've ever seen
Those aren't legs! They're tubes full of frosting, for crying out loud!
Atleast now the tongue is proportionate with the body
From fat... To still fat.
Same... I think I'll go into a medical field instead, though being a mortician sounds interesting as hell. I'd assume the face turned purple due to blood pooling up there... it seems to be one of the lowest parts of her body when laying down.
I did. I was pointing out that when the planet claimed that "well, bullying is illegal too!!" in the pictures, she was wrong.Really, really wrong.
It's impressive how people can just accept to get fat like that. If I saw myself get any where remotely close to getting that fat, I would hope people gave me criticism so I could lose that lard.
He looks like a fucking thumb
It's like it's trying to meld with the (lack of) neck.
No chance of the former. You think she'll exercise enough and eat less enough to even get close to being fit? nah i do not. Death is her only muh'fucking option....diet's not!
Okay, so she's both skinny, normal AND plus-sized. Don't they read their own shit before pressing the *send* button?
I disagree. If you know exactly 10 gallons of water fit in a bucket, and you know exactly 10,000 buckets of water fit in Shamoo's pool, you can use calculations to measure the amount of water in the pool.
Don't forget "the tech industry" as another target of these lunatics.
No it's not. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. Read the wisdom nugget from tumblr, you douche. All of it is genetics, like you. It's ok to be fat. They have no control over it preventing it like you. So it's ok be fat. Don't discriminate because all bodies are good bodies. Eat what you want. It's ok to be fat. - what I learned from tumblr nuggets of wisdom
Men are expendable in their eyes
Really? The true 34s I know wear size 12s and are overweight. The true 36s I've seen, wear 12s-14s+. Possibly a larger frame on taller ladies could put them at a 34 and still be of normal weight. I'm not an expert by any means, but just my observation. 38s, 40s are def overweight if not obese.
You can buy those stickers on amazon and I have seen them in places in my hometown. Dudes who have them are usually chunky or planets themselves
This isn't the right way of solving a problem like that man. If you criticise someone, they'll get defensive about themselves and close up. You can't do shit to them then, and they won't understand. You have to find a way of making them understand without hurting their feelings. They've done horrible shit, but to make them understand that, you need to have a different approach.
Fattest person I know is vegetarian.
You're just as douchey as this fat fuck, you far east mystical bro ninja.
Who the fuck did this ?!?!?!
Where can I sign this petition? I completely agree that we need to shut down fartpeoplehate. Is it really my fault that I like to eat the occasional gigantic bowl of beans or cabbage and then climb ladders in public? Fartpeoplehate is an awful subreddit that just brings shame to this site.
&gt; Eating one huge meal a day could cause this to a degree.Yeah, it does. Because their huge meal starts at 8am and ends at 10pm.
A couple of viagra, squeeze your eyes tightly shut and think of Candice Swanepoel
The breast feeding comment is horrible but at least OP will not smother the baby unlike mama whale and OP will be giving her baby better nutrients.
Ban me.
she's entered the cottage cheese phase.
She should be.
*Vomits*
My sister has it. She keeps in shape and eats healthy. It pisses me off seeing all the excuses especially after seeing all the trouble my sister goes thrugh
Soon we'll overtake r/fatlogic. 3k difference left. Then another 30k to beat FPS.
You're my hero. I hate when people make their dogs fat, obeasts or otherwise
What happens if someone is in a wheelchair or something?
smoking and obese!!! ffs, pick one! actually, pick none. but certainly not both.this really speeds up her suicide.
The fatter they get, the more entitled they get.
That's so weird. I guess you stay out of restaurants then..!
"Oh look, it's dinner time!"
I had that too. I laughed like a lunatic in the planned parenthood waiting room.
Holy shit!! look how jacked it is
It's so tiny! Tiny tiny penis.
The votes on this comment remind me of that sister subreddit.URL
Agreed. CBC has become Fox News North over the last nine years. I miss the days when it was our respected public broadcaster/news agency.
Not to mention what it costs to society to treat them
I told my ex I wasn't attracted to fat people. He responded by saying that when he was older he was probably going to be fat like his dad. His dad is well in the obese range. I didn't even know what to say to that.
My dad had to clean one after Burning Man. He said it would have been easier to just torch it &amp; take the loss.
They feel like they're being oppressed because they're literally being *pressed closer and closer together since the planet can't fucking hold all these hambeasts*.
I feel really bad for the guy with the hat:'(
ewwwwwImagine a fat superhero. Does it count as flying if it hovers 1m above ground at about 1mph when trying to save people?
Exactly. If they think it's so beautiful why are they hiding it?
except the Goodyear blimp is actually pretty neat and this thing is, well...
What did I just read?&gt;I dont give a fuck if youre 399 pounds and live off cheesesteaks and oxygen. If youre a nice guy and carry yourself with positive character traits youre fuckin straight dude.Rule 2?
As soon as she started noticing rapid weight gain she should have taken her ass to the doctor. She is just another whale with condishuns. And now she's gonna have a shitload of money too :/
Lol, "never count fruit or vegetables because it's not real."Hahaha, what? Pretty sure the calories from a banana aren't fake calories. This is why they're fat.
This is basically what happened to every girl (and guy, but more so the girls) that I went to school with in the midwest. Once they got out of high school, they weren't physically active and boom -- transformation.
Hey, a planet's gotta ~~breathe~~ eat.
My cat is strictly indoor and she's 16 years old and healthy. And she isn't fat.
Took the words right out of my mouth.
On behalf of recovering minimoons and hamplanets everywhere, thank you shitlords. You guys save lives daily.
Thank you. I'm totally making this on Saturday.
Keep it up! Fat-shaming with your own body is the best form of fat-shaming. &gt; The lady who greeted us had my neck, so I had to bite my tongue to stop me from laughing or anything.I don't really understand this line. You mean she was really fat with a thin neck?**PS:** Next time, I suggest you walk around the store with something delicious in hand.
Welcome! You'll fun this to be a really friendly place, as long as you're ~~not fat~~ a human being.
Thin privilege: eating chocolate by chunks not bars.
I mean if the fat layer is thicker than the knife blade they'd have to be pretty much fine, right? Infection could still kill easily, though.
Cheers to the people in here demanding hard numbers to back up the graphic. Yay science!
I would argue that people seem to feel more inclined to comment on people's weight if they are anorexic more so than they would to someone who is morbidly obese. People make assumptions that someone who is very slim will have an eating disorder and will question how much they're eating. Yet it's seen to be much ruder to ask an overweight person they're eating too much because you're concerned about their weight.That being said if someone was in the position where they were putting their health at risk to achieve a certain weight, whether it's too low or way too high, then they should be helped.As for telling the difference I'm sure psychological testing would require a number of parameters for diagnosis but I think it would include a skewed body perception (similar to anorexia) and a compulsion driven need to eat. Not just eating out of boredom or laziness or lack of nutritional education but eating excessively while knowing that you're destroying your body. Because anorexics don't think they're healthy, they want everyone to think they're healthy so they can continue their restrictive eating habits.
This reminds me of Lena Dunham. They show her eating straight out of a miracle whip tub on Girls. Edit: It's cool whip not miracle whip. I am not familiar with this shit I never buy.
Just edit the comment and you're good.
dude, den här subredditen är fucking bäst. I love u guki

Sounds like the teacher loves common core!
My favorite thing about this subreddit is how many downvotes you accrue by asking a question to open up a dialogue that doesn't involve attacking a stranger. I'm just asking a biochemistry question. I hate dumb people as much as they hate fat people but I don't let it consume what I do in my spare time on the Internet.
What in the crap does she have on that walker thing? I'm on mobile, so I can't tell if there are any snacks on there to keep her sugahs up!

The title made me laugh. It's the perfect description for my sisters-in-law on Facebook.
The reason you are being downvoted is because you are shitting out fatlogic.
It's a nice gold ring with some precious stones. I wear cheap eBay rings (I like to match clothes, nails &amp; accessories) :p
No, they can't. It's an illness.
Hmm okay.So there are 150 total notes. 8 people added text when they reblogged from the original.Here they are:one:&gt;The enemy of the fat acceptance movement is logic, and factstwo:&gt;Private Fat Bodythree:&gt;WHATS YOUR NAME FATBODYFROM NOW ON YOU ARE PRIVATE PYLEfour:&gt;Smoking isn’t beautiful, alcoholism isn’t beautiful, and a billion people on earth right now with 30-years or more taken off of their lives from chronic obesity is not beautiful. Body positivity is accepting people off all HEALTHY body types. I keep seeing art and bikini pictures lately of actually obese people, and that is NOT body positive. Living a short life riddled with chronic diseases that could 100% be prevented is not beautiful okay. Please know the difference between overweight and obesity. Between a few extra pounds and an early grave.&gt;Oh, and obesity in children is 100% always child abuse always always.five:&gt;This is actually something I’ve been trying to point out for a while. Yes you can be healthy and “overweight”, BUT once you have a certain amount of fat, your body stores it around your organs, etc, which can be very problematic. So if your doctor is telling you that you should lose weight because of reasons like this, they aren’t fat shaming, they’re trying to save your life.Then the sixth one results in a chain where one of the fats argues with a human and it ends like this:&gt;There is NO excuse to be fat. Shut the fuck up [name of fat]seven is a quick back and forth between a fat and a human where the fat tries to guilt the human by saying it cuts itself because of fat-shaming. it ends like this:&gt;THIS IS NOT BODY SHAMMING. BEING OVERWEIGHT IS ONE OF THE MANY RISK FACTORS FOR PREVENTABLE DISEASE!! YOU MAY NOT LIKE MEDICAL ADVICE BUT ITS THE TRUTH.and lovely number 8:&gt;BUT EVERYONE COMES IN DIFFERENT SIZES!&gt;hahaha please…you may be naturally “heavier” and you may have a body type that makes it harder for you to lose weight….But not everyone has that. Most fat people are like that because they are lazy and unable to control themselves.&gt;Being fat isn’t beautiful. Being fat is lazy and unhealthy.So I went back and found that it was the same one fat blogger who started the arguments on all of these, lol. The fat acceptance losers are a minority, but apparently a very internet-vocal one.

Imagine the smell of the oil...eugh
In few years, that fat fuck's tattoo will strecth so much it will look like the map of russia.
I want to deliver, but I have naught to show you :/
Holy shit!
It's *Homo sapiens*.
I just want to see her on a beach and push her over and watch as she tries to get up.
dude, like every other fat chick I see has some arbitrary ass hipster chest tattoo, they think it makes them not ugly, no doubt my first comment is true;  evidence: URL
This gives me an idea...
I also love how they gloss over the five men who were stabbed and the cyclist who was run over by joyriders. *OH NOEZ A BOOTYFUL PROUD WOMYN WAS ASSAULTED BY AN EVIL CISHET SCUM PATRIARCH!!!!*
Camera angles, my friend. Camera angles.
It's definitely Sams Club. That place is awesome.
heh I was thinking the same thing!
BILL! BILL! BILL! BILL!
Can we gas her ? Please. I hate this bitch.
I don't want to incite a riot here but would age play a part in his transformation? I don't think he's exactly that young anymore.
Usually I hate tattoos but that is stunning. I agree that it would be gorgeous on a real person.
You know what really really pisses me off about this She's purposefully wearing pants/leggings that are too small to make herself look more hambeasty and gross than she already is We're actually approaching the point with fat acceptance and shit that people are using clothes and angles to make themselves look more fat! That's past acceptance, its like fat is a goal!
where the shit are fat people getting this "happiness = health" nonsense? I'm happiest a few whiskeys deep but that doesn't mean it's fucking good for me.
A lot of hams eat without even consciously realizing it, so anything that makes them focus on their food is going to help them figure out just how much they are actually eating (and hopefully realize that it's the week's worth of calories that they go through every day making them fat, not genetics or starvation mode).
That's roxxxy Andrews bitch had me up the wall with her thick and juicy bullshit. I haven't really been watching this new season, it seems kind of boring compared to the previous seasons, but ginger Minh can take her ass back to Florida. Girl, bye.
remember rule 1 and 2
I thought they were banned?
There's a Homer Simpson gut bag as well.
Woah, woah.Her stomachs like 6 inches from her face.
I actually have a fatfuck of a coworker that keeps one of these in his right desk drawer and eats off of it throughout the day. We call him Desk Cake. We even tried to encourage him to walk with us at lunch but he'd rather sit there and get the beetus (he's got it already) and complain about how he feels all day. This guy goes to Wendy's all the time and gets a triple Baconator, extra bacon, adds two salt packets then will continue to tell us how good he's doing on his diet since diagnosed with the beetus while he takes a bite. He always goes "I usually don't get these", yes you do you fatfuck! He's shaped like a snowman and I hate his fucking face off his head.
Thanks! It's the first for both and we are super excited! Gonna raise me tiny shitlord who sees food like I do - a bothersome deal we have to consume to keep healthy!
I'm too sexy for this thread.
Let me break it down for you;(What I believe)1/2 of the subscribers/posters of /r/fatpeoplehate genuinely hate fat people.1/2 of the subscribers/posters of /r/fatpeoplehate secretly want to bang fat people.
Woohoo! I'm a member of the least obese professionals! Scientists FTW!
I mean, people lie on the internet.. literally no other idea why he would stir up such a shitstorm in here otherwise.
Yeah, this isn't even a case of "pretty face drowning in obesity", which other fat people might fall for and think (or claim to, at least) is beautiful.
some people have red faces, man. how can you change the color of your face?
I've been getting this a lot at work. I recently lost 80lbs. Now I'm 6'0 175lbs and everyone is saying I need to gain 10 more back. Interestingly enough 10lbs is just enough to put me back into the overweight category. Whatever this is America, no one knows what a healthy weight looks like anymore.
That song infuriates me. It's like the Tumblr National Anthem. And she's not a planet but she's not a stick either which means all the girls her size that *should* go on a diet won't think they need to because "her message" is to be proud of your size. Yuck. Also, that song is just fucking annoying as hell on top of it.
It's been four days since she brushed her hair, so I'll venture it's been at least a week since she washed it. "Things like self care have fallen by the wayside" is fattyspeak for "I haven't actually bathed in two weeks, and have been sitting around in a cloud of my own stink."Then again, self care actually fell by the wayside when she gave up on life and herself and decided it was easier to go full beetus.
Yeah but in the end she'll still die from a heart attack and she will probably do before she has a chance to spend any of the money, so we can all be happy still.
No I'll start it overHere rolls the bride,Here rolls the bride,All fat and wide,Where is the groom?Drinking Drano in the bathroom.

Don't get me wrong, I'd be embarrassed to even stand near her. Bad choice of words.
Actually, higher pressure increases the boiling temperature /science
Maybe i need a girlfriend...
Yep, took her 5 years to age 10.
Out of two, I'd give you one
"And I'm pretty sure someone shit themselves"It's a genetic function shitlord, you've never heard of intuitive shitting? Whenever you feel the need to go, just shit yourself. Since that's what your body wants.
why does it smile
Did it ever pop. I hope the fatty pops.
Nope. But you can gamble. Haha Since you're already talking to girls in the area I don't think you'll having a hard time finding someone to acquire a bottle for you. Mix a drink in a water bottle and no one will care. Lol
Nudist hams are starting to take over :( There is a reason why they say fit people look better naked
And now I do as well.
/r/thathappened
Personally, I'm of the belief that solely by being fat he is already self-centered. I don't really workout for myself. I workout because I know that any self-respecting man/woman wants a guy that looks just as good if not better than they do, and if they diet and exercise properly, then they deserve someone better than a fat fuck to come home to.
I've been on the internet so long that pictures of dead bodies don't even phase me. But this...*gag*
If you're a gymnast and you're built like that, you're doing something wrong. My daughters are gymnasts. They are fit and muscular--and certainly nowhere even remotely near overweight. Gymnastics training is VERY demanding. I can't imagine what this lead balloon's diet must be like.
Oh. That's just water.For a moment I thought they'd shit themselves. Which would also hold up the ride...
Wouldnt that be the shit, getting rich off of fat people. I need to look into this.
Soju is a hell of a thing.
That's why I drink.
Just like with auto insurance. Oh, you got drunk and hit someone? Yeah you're going to pay for that. Oh, you overate and got the beetus? Not our problem tubby.
Hey, instead of posing with real humans, shouldn't you get back to changing laws and shutting down the Internet? Fat fuck
Aren't they udders at that point? Or are they teats?
This is a gross exaggeration but yeah the gym is noticeably worse during the first half of January before all the hams and idiot quit after not seeing results after two weeks.
Ugh. This viewpoint only teaches young girls to hear an opinion and go "oh! How does this opinion affect ME?! How do I need to change to fit this person's opinion?!" Fuck that and fuck these fat asses using young girls as an excuse to restrict free speech and health consciousness. We need to raise our children, both boys and girls, to hear an opinion and go "oh, well that's interesting. I understand that there are all sorts of different opinions on this planet and that this shouldn't immediately influence how I view myself" otherwise, we are raising a generation of weak victims that will find any excuse to hate themselves but never change because it is SOCIETY'S fault.
That poor poor counter.
I think that's a slippery slope argument. I have no sympathy for those who refuse or game recovery to stay emaciated. But those who are addressing their issues get a break. Not an excuse, they still need to be gaining until they're in a healthy range, but the disorder that put them there should be acknowledged as a barrier.
I own a few pokemon and basic shirts from wal-marts boys section for sleeping in. They also, are large on me.I give of just give up on the whole thing.
I remember that episode. She must know after saying that, the other people in the store are going to mock her mercilessly. If a skinny lady said that, she's just a bitch... but a woman of her impressive girth becomes some kind of evil swamp behemoth in tales of lore.
Is it supposed to be wrinkled like that? God dammit, porker, get yourself an iron. Oh wait, that would require it to be standing for more than a few minutes.
Yeah seriously eating out is the worst thing to do if you wanna lose weight. Restaurant portions are huge and filled with oil. Even some salads can be 1000+ at a restaurant.
He was sitting IN FRONT OF YOU?!? That is even more revolting. Ugh I'm disgusted by your story. I agree, how is that even remotely acceptable in his mind?! WTF.
Of course we do, otherwise how can they be special snowflakes and show just how *unique* they are?
"Whatever this is called"Fupa, sweetheart. It's a Fupa.

Hams have now gone from just eating every piece of food they can find, to eating confidence too. Fucking dreadful. I hope your sister feels better soon OP.
Ok, fair enough.
My state has an extremely limited medical marijuana law in place. Only people with severe illnesses like MS or Parkinson's are allowed to get a permit. It sucks because while I do have a debilitating illness, it's not on the list, so I'm shit out of luck. I like my state; I don't want to have to move to Colorado to be treated..
More like *wide* release.
No :(They've already achieved orbit and I can't get them back.

I mean if you're going out to McDonalds, naturally anyone is gonna pick a mcdouble and some nugs over an overpriced salad that has been sitting in a refrigerator for a week. But, as someone who worked at McDonalds, no one should go to McDonalds. Ever. Just go to the store and stock up on a week of fucking food. That way you don't have to go drive somewhere every time you're hungry.
Yes, he's not a revisionist. His "claim to fame" is having Piper say on camera in 1992, something that was known and proven by R.Faurisson in 1975 when Faurisson managed to get the original plans for Krema 1,2 and 3 from the Auschwitz archives.Cole then goes "into hiding" (the ADL beat-down and threats are under scrutiny) and starts producing pro-Holocaust movies. Now he is insulting actual revisionists who have suffered way more than he has and honors lowlifes like Weber and Irving (who was never a revisionist).He's just coming back on the scene to pump money out of his naive supporters because his pro-holocaust buddies left him out in the cold and Cole needs to feed his drug habit.Not to mention that he believes in the Treblinka "death camp" stories based not on any evidence but on one telegram.
i joined anthony nolan organization few years ago but i am not a match for anyone yet sadly ;(
Seeing this reminds me of how I feel I look like in some dresses. I have violin hips and they look like I have a muffin top in more form fitting dresses so I don't wear them. At least I know I look better in flared dresses. I hate my hips.
I fucking hate fatties as well. Fat is UGLY

Aaron Donald is an all pro d-tackle at 280 pounds. Tess on the other hand...is a living breathing reproducing piece of fucking shit. The carbon atoms that assembled to form her gigantic fucking pile of mayonnaise body is by far the worst thing the universe has ever assembled. I think the only logical thing to do at this point is drop her off north of the border for an Inuit family. They'll know exactly how to make the most of this whales corpse.
And vice-versa
That look on his face indicates that he was *barely* he was able to lift her. That's the look of a man hitting a PR on a deadlift.
If only it was a joke!

Why is a fat piece of shit in a fashion show?
It'll always be a planet in my eyes.
Research has shown that PCOS causes at max 5-10 pounds increase in weight, not 50-100 pounds.
Gotta love the other girl's face in 5. The ham is making a muscle and her expression pretty much sums up how most people feel about that.
Get verified. Nuff said.
*gained 10lbsMy bad.
Every fat has a "story" it seems.
"Average" ....God help us
YOU'RE* FOR FUCKS SAKE!!! YOU'RE!!!!!
"I know how to behave in a kind and respectful manner when I have to interact socially. Why doesn't that make up for my grotesque body and personality flaws?"  Because being able to interact with people, without being rude and caustic is the bare fucking minimum.
Holy shit dude, my sister, dad and I all get dizzy when we stand up. She's been diagnosed by a doctor with an actual genetic disorder as a result of several pass outs as a result, and she's the shortest of the three of us at 5'10". If that shitty sensation can be gone with abs I am SO in! Thanks for mentioning it!

Sometimes I like to imagine that the fat props their legs up. And that the whales can never really fall over, because they just end up landing on more fat.
That argument is fallacious anyway, all they have to do is eat less of the food they currently eat.
Is that what you call that? I get it in leggings (don't wear bikinis) and I just refer to it as my pants doing the thing.
Which brands if I may ask?
I always suspected that rbf was intentional
Good luck! The ability to develop a strong one is largely genetic (much like whether you have 4, 6 or 8 pack abs), but doesn't mean it's not worth trying for ;)
I love hen the ban hammer comes down on people.
The portable trusses they were secured to had some flex for all participants, but yeah...I truly thought the whole rig was going to come down when this one came out.
Yeah the portion thing is a really big point.
I was trying to come up with something too but they're basically just two sagging veiny alien brains put out on display like a ribbon winning pig.
I am humbled by the warm welcome, ~~m'lady~~ lady shitlord.
That's a spray tan she's sporting...
Yep. This woman sat there and talked to the Supersizer about how happy she was and how she wants to gain even more weight. It was a COMPLETE 180 from the previous week (the woman who was taking the dance class and was actually working at losing some weight). It was horrifying! Did you see how she even looked right at Dr. Christian and said that "if the doctors say so I can dial it back"? I find it difficult to believe ~~her doctors aren't PLEADING with her to stop gaining!~~ she even goes to the doctor. If she does, shame on them for not sending her to the psychiatric hospital, as she clearly suffers from massive^tee^hee delusions and is engaging in self-harm behaviour.
Lol proof that fatties just blindly buy shit they see tess in.
Some people enjoy the little cliche courtships rituals, some don't. I think my dates get more out of the wallet dance than I do. I love the little puffed up swell of pride they get saying "No, no, put that away, I won't let you pay." If you just sit back and say nothing you kind of rob them of that moment.
Ugh, how bad do you feel for that thin model? I can't imagine the amount of scrubbing it took afterward to get the stench off.
Or it should be black and yellow stripes with the words "oversize load" and equipped with visibility flashers.
No no, you're fine. I was heading off anyone who was going to come after me for generalising mums who don't breastfeed or something. I agree with you.
her head is titled up because if she looks down the fat collapses her wind pipe.
People say stuff like this to smokers all the time. Has she not seen the countless commercials and campaigns saying smoking kills?
Great, thanks Homer :)
I think I just vomited in my mouth a little
Finally. People only seem to recognize extremes, like super thin or super fat.

Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, also has clouds... coincidence?
If you'd told me that was the same guy after de-hamming, I'd believe you.
This. There is such a thing has having a heavier bone structure. I have big bones, but I weigh 160 lbs right now. Big boned means my wrist is 6.5 inches around rather than 6 (medium frame) or 5 - 5.5 (small frame). It might at 10 lbs to my weight if I am really, really generous.
Jesus, that model is attractive. It helps that she's thin, healthy, fit, and therefore attractive and superior.
If you hate people that have done nothing to hurt you in any way you are an asshole. Period. Whether it be gays, a specific race, etc. doesn't matter. You are a low quality, low intelligence person.
[I've made this photo a little happier](URL
Sounds to me like OP just wanted to brag about her superiority, not just to obeasts, but every pregnant woman on the planet. I have had three kids, the last one was 10 pounds, and I have never had anyone say that I had the license to eat whatever I wanted. Big deal, you had a kid and lost the weight. I did, too.
I just imagined the smell between his ass and the seat
This tub of lard must have left a repulsive odor to boot.
Seriously, what is that? Is it some growth or tumor?
I think they mean natural, not artificial, facial features, e.g. eyes, etc.
No coal please!
Dresses?
Not to mention that a person with a great personality isn't the type to throw bitch fits.
What, you trying to say I'm not packing 12?
This is exactly how my boyfriend is, he's 6' tall and has lost at least five pounds in the last couple months--he's 145 pounds. He just doesn't have the appetite to eat during the day.
Maybe the elevation is so high and the air is so thin, fat people can't sustain life there.

What doesn't piss off hams? Honestly, other than giving them food, is there anything else that makes them happy?
What a piece of shit.
Yes but the petite posters are typically not fat. So the petite women alone are outpacing the fat women. Plus there are so many other subreddits (GoneWild, ginger, asstastic, gonemild, etc.) which feature non-fat women. So add those all together and the preference is clear. Fat women are just a fetish, less popular than (say) petite women.
I actually had this problem as a kid, up until I was about 16 or 17. Doctor had to put me on a special diet because I was eating my parents out of house and home, and still was underweight.
I hate that their voice is heard louder, because we are just being bigots. Edit: poor word choice
Calm down Gwendolin.
It's so backwards.
This bitch looks like Drew Carey in a cheap wig.
That's like staring into the ass of Satan.
This fills me with so much rage that my pinky is hovering near the caps lock button. I'm glad you switched doctors because he was clearly an idiot.Irony note: my comment could have easily been a supportive response to an FA blogger saying that she switched doctors 5 times till she found one that said she could be fat and healthy at the same time.
Blame autocorrect like 99% of the people do. Anyways, you get A+ for fat shaming.
How old is that thing?
I disagree with this one. She looks like she's within the normal zone. She looks like BMI around 23. Maybe the outer edge of normal, but still normal. She just looks like she doesn't do cardio.
They had a KFC, Taco Bell and Subway in every direction though. I was there earlier this year and was amazed by how many fast food places there were.
I know right !? Blowjobs while taking a crap – I need to call my girlfriend immediately, I feel a bowel movement coming along.
I hope this backfires on the SJW fatties. I don't even know what the difference is between the feeling fat emoticon or any of the other ones.So now when shitlords indulge a little and want to say they are feeling fat they will probably just start saying "Had a brownie for my cheat day feelingfat" or some shit like that. That would be much for vocal that an stupid emoticon.
They keep on calling slim chicks bony. Like they have a skeletton feel. This is bullshit. My wife feels great in my arms. Bony = starved Africa. And those guys deserve the food those fat fucks are over eating here.
Take off the identifyinginfo.

To be fair, it IS one of the few jobs where you can be fired for the sole reason of being a fatbody.
reddit seems to have enough issues with stability, don't need anymore reasons for reddit to crash.as further proof of the issue with reddit, i got "an error occurred (status: 503)" as i tried to post this comment.
She also claims to be "queer" while enjoying all that heteronormative privilege. (Excuse me while I puke for talking like one of them.)
Nah, ours has a Subway.
No thanks, I'm pretty sure I'm more fit than someone who needs to lift their fupa to take a piss. If I ever need to know how to eat two cakes simultaneously while not choking on my fat tears, I'll seek you out.
I feel sorry for tattoo artist.

The average woman is also overweight.
Yeah, at home. Not on the crowded subway.Seriously I wish I was kidding but there's this man in my bus who sits in the middle of 5 seats and spread so much he takes 3 of them. Like man, you have a future in gymnastic.
I think we did. So few people talk about diabetes that's unrelated to fatties that it's nice to talk to someone with Type 1 who gets it.
Because they are the majority and can thus outvote normal people.
A little shot out of my nose as well.
"We are never ever ever getting back together"Said the clasp on her pants.
We have a traditional pastry day in my family. Wednesday is market day in my home town and my gran used to always bring something sweet home. We still honour that tradition. So I def can't have a candy bar every day because I already have pie every week. Plus I tutor 2 muslim boys and I just can't say no to their gran. She just doesn't allow it. Especially now that I'm 'starving myself to be scrawny'. She would force feed me if she could. Yesterday she cut up Tunisian tahini breakfast paste in massive chunks. It's basically 50% sesame paste and 50% sugar. I kind of died on the inside because I don't even like it that much. But if I say no she makes me eat even more. So yeah, no candy bars for me lol.
&gt;On second thought maybe a little running to the closest fast food joint would prevent their bodies to enter into starvation mode.
I think that 100% of the people who have told me I'm too skinny have been obese.
A real shitdoldierYou make us proud
To be honest, the whole "fattest man/woman in the world" thing is only graded on whoever actually comes forward to claim the title. For all we know, there could be a potentially 363kg/800lb hamgalaxy rendered immobile by adipose in a basement somewhere. Fuck, there probably is. If you ever feel bad about yourself, always remember that there's some fat fuck in a basement who won't even be able to be removed to be buried.
WHERE IS MY EYE BLEACH OP?! I goddamn deserve it, after that album.
Maybe your bananas are not ripe enough when you eat them. Unripe bananas give a lot of people stomach pains. When you eat bananas make sure that they have brown spots on the skins and the skins easily peel off. Before that, they are too ripe and hard on your digestive system.
Oh God. That's something not even a corset can fix. Edit: I saw the rest of the pics. Now I'm blind.

You can also try mineral water (without artificial sweetener). It tastes different from straight up water, but it has no calories and also helps replenish minerals. Just make sure you get one of the low-sodium varieties like Crystal Geyser or Trader Joe's.
It's a little tough to say for sure on my phone, but I'm pretty sure that pic has been 'shopped to hell and back to give her that shape and that interesting outline of 'abs'.I can hardly fathom the idea that there's fatties out there that 'love' her body and aspire to get a body like it. I mean a body that size would be a good first step for many out there, but that is still larger than human size and setting the bar pretty damned low.
She went way overboard on peanutbutter, those eggs are like 85% peanutbutter
Right, but as a word, it works better here, and when it comes down to it, being half your healthy bodyweight is less common than being 4 times your healthy bodyweight- and as delusional as anorexia makes you, at least it's a genuine psychological delusion, rather than just rationalization for being a selfish cunt.
URLDon't hate me. Hate the majority of people who think Caucasian people or more attractive. You keep throwing around buzzwords like racist and nazi - I don't think you know what either of those things mean. Again, statistics doesn't make me racist and I haven't put forward a personal opinion on the subject for you to use to criticize my character. You just sound like you're hypersensitive to racial issues and you're drawing false conclusions to get butthurt about because you love the feeling of being indignant. tl;dr - unbiased observers who read this are gonna think you're an idiot and I'm not racist.
I wear men's briefs and boxer briefs some times. :( They're pretty comfortable and sometimes have cool patterns on them. Usually just for sleeping in though. They'd look weird under jeans or dresses.
I have your same problem, I've found that skirts/dresses look better on me when they start at my natural waist. However this chick could have looked normal if she had just worn better underwear. You would be surprised at the difference it makes. Too tight/small underwear can create a muffin top if you have even the slightest bit of fat.
I hope I don't need to add an /s.
I took crossfit for two months and I had to stop because most of the people there were over weight. I was struggling in the first week but then a lady that had to be fifty pounds overweight said it gets easier that she had been doing it for a year. It took everything to control my face because she was grossly out of shape for a year of crossfit.
Hispanic channels are loaded with these infomercials and theyalways havw skinny attractive people using the product.
Thats cute. He called it a "size acceptance" movement.
Yeah, probably shoulda quoted that, I'm not a nice guy, I'm an asshole who holds myself and others accountable, when you want something done effectively and efficiently, you don't call a nice guy, you call an asshole.
85% of your daily saturated fat in a single serving...you know, if you only ate celery for a few weeks and needed that to survive...it's a good source.
You sure it wasn't because of the guy hitting a bong?
Do you think the fold on top of her swallowed knee is full of fungus? Why does she even dress up and take pictures?
So you kept the 10%, then? What would you want with that many shirts in the first place?
So what did he get instead of his chicken? I couldn't quite make it out.

You can find it in stores or on eBay if you're lucky.. They only have it in large sizes though lol... Like it matters

It would be interesting talking to a dam. Not very pretty though.
Perfect.
She has nice serial killer stare going on.
Can you imagine that is the last hope they have is that their personality are better because they are fat? Fat fuck are selfish and they don't ever think about anyone else. Once they realize hey this fit dude is not a Jerk and is actually real nice they have nothing. Nothing at all. So they cling to the idea as their shirts cling on their fat stomachs. Lazy fucks.
That poor poor earthbound cartridge, what a waste
Hey, if the farm animal fits...
There is something wrong with all of you. You guys must be incredibly insecure.

One metric ton is equal to 1000 Kg or 2204.62 lbs.

Well.Guess which type of girl you can have an arm under without having said arm buzz within 5 minutes?Guess which type of girl enjoyes being close to you to you the most on a cold evening because she isn't insulated like an adult seal?Guess which type of girl doesn't get up in the middle of the night for a snack?

Oh god.
Don't worry man. I don't care about the points itself. Its about what does that mean.It is what is behind, like people upvoting those "I can't eat more than 600 calories a day", we can see the intention and mentality of a sub by the downvotes. I couldn't care less about my points.
Yes he is fat. However, that was a clean 600 pound squat and a clean POWERLIFTING bench press. Watch any power lifting competition skinny or fat they all contort themselves like that. The deadlift would have been fine if there were clips on the bar. Would his lifts be more impressive if he wasn't fat? Fuck yes. But you can't chastise his lifts. They were clean

I have read that getting really fat can cause facial hair in hams because it fucks with their hormones. Add that to the pile of why being obese is disgusting.

Profession: cosmetologist That combination doesn't seem right. .
&gt; The obese are abused, in O’Rahilly’s view, condemned by society as feckless, weak-willed and lazy. He disagrees, saying dryly: “I think it is much worse to cheat on your wife, or park in a disabled space.&gt;“I don’t consider it as morally reprehensible as stuff that actively harms other people. You could be just as reprehensible by going off on a skiing holiday and costing the health service a fortune by breaking your leg.”

Fat lurkers see it yourself ,even fat chicks don't want you. lower your weight and higher your standards.

I don't think TPW realized the consequences of his actions. Either way he's the creator of the sub, not much we can do. Best to let it go.
A fat trainer is like an alcoholic AA sponsor.
They should post the calorie counts below them instead of the sizes.
I wish her arms would just go away. There aren't words to describe how much her arms disgust me. Even in this pic where her legs look like they are doing impossible things, I can't help but stare at those arms. They make me question everything I know about the very nature of existence.

The reason why hams are obsessed with Disney is that they never want to grow up. It is so obvious at this point. They only want to gorge on junk food. They constantly want to be viewed as "cute". They cry when they don't get what they want.

FA is like the thing that won't die even if its leaders often die before the age of 50. AIDS denialism still exists.
it's a dude with moobs, me thinks.
I'm old enough to remember when these episodes were on TV. Fat women like the ones shown were not something you saw every day.These days, I wouldn't notice any of them as extremely overweight.
I'm sure they're fat and all but I can relate as a 32 year old.
Yeah exactly. I love burgers and fries and pizza it's all so amazing; it's just not my main diet but it's not like I avoid it at all costs. I mean, it's burgers and fries and pizza! Haha
Small airplane pilots. I've seen a few here and there, but for the most part it's normal sized people. The FAA is already trying to shitlord by saying if your BMI is over a certain number they want you to participate in a "sleep study" to make sure you don't have sleep apnea. Because why should pilots be in shape and have a good nights rest, right?
A panic attack because of calories being displayed? Personally I wish every place serving food had to list the calories in each dish. I like being able to count and keep track of how much I'm consuming. It's the most effective way to avoid overeating.
Re: "But I'm healthy!!!" You may be OK now, but think about where you'll be ten years from now. We don't tell people to wear seatbelts because they're in a crash RIGHT NOW. It's about prevention. Being obese makes you much more likely to have all kinds of problems down the track.

I think it honestly has to do with time, this fat stuff didn't get glorified in media until recently. Anorexia on the other hand has been in the media for a while, all those 90s heroin chic models popularized it and then there was a backlash. Same thing will happen here but far more glorious. We just must give it time.
I didn't get banned (yet), but trollxchromosomes hates me (us).
I will. I usually don't have to though. There's normally a mod around that sees it.

&gt;*Healthy* 13stThat word..
I'm built like that too, I was not a very sexy teenager, lol. I never cracked 100 lbs until my junior year of high school (I am 5'4" and have been since I was like 9). I was a twig. Even back in the late 90's/early 00's I was getting referred to the counselor at school for eating disorder just because I was skinny. I didn't eat very much at school because I was vegan and back then being vegan or vegetarian wasn't really a thing, so I couldn't eat really anything that was available. I ate plenty at home though. I did start to fill out around 16 years old, though I will never be truly "curvy", I have a pretty athletic frame, but its at least definitely feminine now. I am now about 120 lbs and love the way I look. No, I don't really have hips, and no my hip/waist ratio is not ideal, but I am fit and healthy.Squats and push ups enhance the butt and chest and help us less curvy ladies get our booty on :) And no she does NOT need a cheeseburger. When you have no natural hips, extra weight does not look good...trust me...I was my heaviest at 140 and it was horrible. I've got friends my height that can pull off 140. I can not. I don't care because it keeps me motivated to stay trim and fit and I have learned to really love my slender rectangular body shape. And take it from me, the guys LOVE it.What really disturbs me is how distorted our cultures view of a normal body is. See collarbones? Hip bones? MUST BE STARVING. Hey genius, the reason you can see collar bones and hip bones on a thin person is because, unless you are a body builder, there is essentially no muscle in those places. That means, if it's not covered by EXCESS FAT, you can see it! It's totally normal! It's ok to see ribs too, god damn.
She and the Belgian Health Minister should ~~go on a food rampage~~ do lunch.
They are compensating.
They dont even see the hypocrisy in that though. Its a sea of irony and double standards. Scary part of all this? They seem to have a majority of support, its like the delusion is infecting others. FPH here is like the only group that sees the reality of this. And dares to speak against the fat acceptance. We need more of this.

Dear lord you could fit a side of beef in those pockets.... He probably does! Haha
i was expecting a picture of his wife, are you his wife?
Open minded kwt ?
Yes! I have had issues with body dysmorphia and anorexic tendencies and what pushed me into my worst place was DIRECTLY RELATED to the FA "movement" (lmao the only movement they're making.) I have been described as curvy, in the true/traditional sense, but because the term is used to describe fatties I took it negatively and felt horrible about myself. I'd wonder, do I look like those women? And conclude that yes I must fall on that end of the spectrum so therefore I'm a fucking tub of lard. It took me so long to get over that hangup and see the truth! Ugh! They directly contribute to the problem!!
Whats the difference between fatty clothes and garbage bags? *Not a thing.*

Rumour has it she ate a kid and his lollipop after he refused to give up the lollipop.
I love the mod posts of messages they get from fatties complaining "I thought this was a place to point out the flaws in their thinking, not rip on people who are trying to improve themselves." Lol, we're not in r/Fatlogic for a reason. The sub's title and rules are pretty fucking clear. The fact that people who are overweight try and get verified as NOT being overweight just proves how deluded all hams are.They always get all high and mighty too like, "If I'm not welcome here just 'cause I've got a little extra then I don't plan on coming back." GOOD. We don't want your fat ass here and we all know you're not gonna lose the weight anyway.
what.the.absolute.fuck
I breed, train, and sell draft and draft crosses. I know alot of you mean well, but your knowledge is a bit off on it. My personal horse is a percheron/arab cross, weighs in at about 1350 pounds. We breed them especially for mountain trips and they will carry easily 300+ pounds of equipment easily, all day into the Yukon, sometimes over quite a few mountain ranges before the pack trip is over.Though i do agree the horse in the picture should NOT be toting that sack of dead weight, especially with a saddle that fits neither horse or rider... The horse looks malnutritioned, hardly any topline muscle, (which are the muscles that support the weight) so I guess it is pretty obvious why they let the woman ride. Money rules all sadly for many, especially now that the horse market is shit in North America due to the fight against horse slaughter.Lack of knowledge is causing much suffering.
If she knew what it was like to have a miscarriage she wouldn't fucking joke about it. Not like anyone would fuck her anyway.

no.
You do realize there are athletes that are in wheelchairs? Weather a person does it for body building, fun or just to have some company, a disabled person should be able to visit a gym.
They are supposed to be used to buy things to prepare meals, so basically most healthy foods. It's not wise to waste them on junk when you are usually given about $100-$200 a month (I think that's around what my family of 3 gets) only.
That dead look in the first photo makes me so sad. How could these people not be charged for abuse? that is no quality of life for anything...

Excellent inspiration. Makes the run and long walk I just did seem even more worthwhile.
The benefits of exercise are plentiful. Muscle hypertrophy, increased bone density, and improved cardiovascular response are among the many benefits of physical exercise. For fat loss though, control of calories is a necessity.
Man I wish I could consume that many calories per meal. Think of the gains.
This to me is more damaging to young people than shit like Rihanna getting back together with Chris Brown after he beat her- Rihanna caught a lot of flak for that because she's a "role model to young women." Did Adele catch any for this bullshit? I doubt it very highly. Instead I think it more likely that she was lauded for her willingness to buck Hollywood's image-centric nature and blah blah blah.This is a fucking dangerous and irresponsible mindset to have. Obesity is a goddamned epidemic and fat fucking celebrities like Adele and fucking Lena Dunham who are "comfortable in their skin" and "proud of who they are" and all that other fat-excusing bullshit only feed (pun intended) the epidemic. Our kids are miniature landwhales racing (rolling?) to an early, heart disease caused grave, and we lift up (or try to) celebrities like this fat lard who are proud to be different. Adele, don't be proud to be different. You can be skinny and still sing well, you ignorant piece of shit. In fact, you'd probably have a longer career if you did, because it wouldn't be ended early by catastrophic heart failure, which is what happens when you make your heart lug around your fat ass all goddamned day.Fuck this shit pisses me off.
Can't forget about the Deep South. We have lots of whales here.
"dare to love my fat body and be sex positive".Like you have a fucking choice you stupid fuck.
I don't even understand the picture. Is it supposed to look like they're blowing them?
Lots of obese women like to use the term "curvy" as a substitute for fat.
Something tells me this thing wouldn't float.
Because they take facts as personal insults. Those facts are so damaging to their delusions that they have strong violent reactions towards them.

Exactly how oblivious of your body's functions do you have to be, not to realise you have A FUCKING GIANT FETUS in it? She was obviously filling her body with shit the whole time. I knew my mini-shitlords were gestating after a couple of weeks at most, and they weren't planned. It's pretty scary that these fe-whales are breeding at all, let alone 'by surprise'. Hopefully she'll tell the kid how s/he was a big fat surprise, so s/he can learn how NOT to live.
They probably use their bodyweight on the machines. Thus they can crush the lat pulldown like a nurse trying to help them walk.
Yeah, I feel like it's an overcompensation for knowing how awful they look. They project this cockiness that's just terribly offputting. But then I've never weighed 400 pounds, so what do I know
It's even more obvious since she's sitting next to a human wearing the same 'idea' of the outfit she was going for (relaxed-sexy pieces with corset overtop) except.. well the choices by the human are much more tasteful and the corset is actually doing what it was meant to, whereas SeaMunster looks like she rolled through a Goodwill dumpster and got caught in tent lining.

He's a glutton who ate so much and exercised so little his stomach literally hangs over his crotch. So because he's a slob with no self control he gets a free pass, concert tickets, a group of internet followers, and is apparently immune to criticism. So where can I pick up my concert tickets and immunity to criticism? I managed to not eat my body into deformity. Surely that deserves a reward right?

Then just how do people go about getting thin privilege if it's not earned?

They're unsightly for sure, but there's just.... so. Much. Cellulite on her thighs. (Yes, I know it's genetic and skinny women have it, too.) Plus, you've got the fact that it looks like she's melting and that her knees are knocked in from the strain.

I'm gonna guess you misinterpreted my post. The one I'm referring to is the girl in the link i posted. Not Amber Rose (who i never said wasn't fat to begin with)Based off of height and weight (assuming it is correct from internet sources, height checks out) she has a BMI of 21.5....looking at her pics, she doesn't seem to have excessive fat. Iggy is A-ok in my book, from looks and technical standpoint as well.
Watching my calories and working out.
&gt;Finally if you are constantly counting calories and obsessing over the number then of course you are going to be miserable and it will be hard to lose weight or stay skinny or fit.Lost 28 pounds counting calories, keeping it off by counting calories.

I got into a huge argument with that guy. He called me fat, and then I told him prove he wasn't the fatty. He posted a photo without any time stamp or screen name.

I never even thought that the skin would be an issue when I decided to kick myself in the ass and lose weight. Didn't even consider it. Yup, I have some, not loads or anything...I won't be wearing a bikini or anything, but I look fantastic with clothes on and I don't look my age, so fuck it. I'd much rather be 135 pounds less and look hotter and be healthy than use something so fucking lame as an excuse. Besides, loose skin comes from fast weight loss usually. I lost 85 pounds of my weight in less than six months. That's how I ended up with it. Stupid hams.
they have fewer options, only so many clothes are made that large.
That's okay. It's not like they have much sticking out of the fupa to really think about anyway.
Dat ass.
Same story with my ex! He would get offended when I asked him to work out with me, and get all insecure when I would workout alone and ask "who are you trying to look good for?" I was happy to drop the 220 lbs of dead weight.

I don't have any shits to give for someone who completely threw their life away, with a smile on their face the entire time. If she croaks it's entirely her own fault. Not like people didn't tell her to quit shoving food in her face hundreds of times. Boo hoo. You know what's not fair? A child with terminal cancer. Having life taken away from you before you get a chance to live is unfair. Sorry if I don't have the energy or will to cry over a glutton who had no appreciation for its life.

Man, I get these pm's constantly. I consider myself a fairly attractive, healthy guy. I mean I lift weights every day and run a couple miles every other day. My profile specifically says I'm only interested in active, healthy, like-minded women. But I'll bet dollars to donuts when checking a pm, she's gonna be at least a 200-pounder. Nine times out of ten I'm right. I just don't get it. I don't consider myself God's gift to women by any means, but Ive never had to settle for banging an orca whale before, and I'm not about to start now. Why do they think a healthy, thin guy would be attracted to obesity? I mean if I were a fat slob, I wouldn't bother with messaging cute thin chicks unless I had a picture of me driving a Lamborghini on my profile, or I wanted my ego bruised a bit.

My personal favorite line from the article:See this is what The Fats don’t understand. Almost 100% of the time there’s a practical reason to discriminate against them. Its not just like “Oh you’re not pretty.” Thats definitely a part of it, but its not the full reason. Its more like “You’re not pretty, and it costs an extra nickel per hour to haul your fat ass all over the world.”

Why would anyone want to draw on eyebrows twice the size of normal brows? It looks awful. I can't even imagine what it looks like in real life. Surely you'd just see the drawn on brow on the skin, with nothing to do with the brow. It's like drawing on a beauty spot. WHY!

Fatties only stand under extreme duress. Much easier to take a creepy picture and whine about it online instead.
What's hilarious about her and a few others like her (e.g. Megan Trainor) is that as much as they complain about genetics, they actually have absurdly good genetics for hiding weight gain. The fact that Tess is that huge and still has a face that even looks human is an amazing feat of genetics. Meanwhile, my "blessed genetics" that supposedly keep me slim mean that if I gain more than 20 pounds on a bulk my face is going to look like the damn Pillsbury Doughboy. I can have veins all over my arms, shoulders and calves and still have chubby cheeks and a (small) spare tire.
Healthy diet + exercise != pseudoscience
They seem to be people who interpret the word differently. Yes, we have our definitions to give structure but the application of the meaning can still be vague.
Tumblr idiots think this kind of personality is a good thing. It's "quirky" and "edgy" and makes them soooooo unique.
People who eat massive amounts of carbohydrates (e.g. typical american diet) have massive, smelly stool. It's a simple fact. Feces are actually a really strong proxy for the health of the person making them. Metabolically healthy people will have small, compact stool that doesn't reek. Ideally, it should be a type 3 on the Bristol stool scale.
Those vegies: looks like roughly 500 calories TOTAL. The nuts, which im having trouble seeing through your nasty ass yellow fingers, probably around 1-2k, so you have 2500, maybe up to 3000 calories. You only eat 1500 a day? are you sick? do you exercise? because just because your skinny does not mean your healthy, and judging by your nails, id get a blood test, or at the very least see a derma.

Awwww, no! You need those! Don't do that.
Thanks for the pics. Motivates me more to keep me as i am. Might lose some fat just to be sure

Holy shit guys gold? Wow thanks a bunch kind stranger, I'd never thought in a million years I'd ever get some gold!
I really pity you americans. It must hurt so much to look around and see more and more fat, disillusional idiots all sourrounding you.
No, it was a general reddit meetup. You'd have heard if we were planning our own - which might actually happen next year.
But I just got here! I like it here! Its so motivating.
That is a campaign I would get behind. Type one should be called "panchritus" or something, and type 2 should be called "Bardus adipemieitus" (stupid fatfuck).
Her body is a dumpster for all the garbage food she feeds it though.

Dear Tigress Osborn I actually do love my body. That's why I'm not a lard ass. Sincerely, An Asshole

cocky fatty eh? "totally down to get a bj from you" wtf! who says that?!?!
Ah, I see you guys are coming in here from the outside to be cunts. Fair enough. See rule 2, cunt.Banned.
I hate her for so many reasons and now I can add one more.
You guys must have worked your asses off. Great job.

Why do they let fat fucks in to begin with? Isn't there some kind of pre-screen or something? There should be with government spending being through the roof as it is.
You know the thing is, NOBODY is born fat. Some even get through childhood lean. How could you possibly look at yourself in the mirror each morning and watch more and more lines and muscles dissapear behind layers of fat, then just move on?
It is... but it's totally empty
its okay. hes a fucking loser and Shannon has so much support and shes actually in remission at the moment :) thanks for your support
I gave up sleeping in the nude when I found out how many shit particles are released when you fart. I love to hug my blanket into my face too much to worry about basically wiping my ass with my lips and nose after a shitty dinner.

As a Pharmacist, I can tell you that there is actually a basis to that!Broccoli is rich in vitamin K, and some anticoagulation drugs (e.g. Warfarin) are dependant on vitamin K clotting factors. So altering your levels of vitamin K though diet could alter your INR which is something that must be tightly controlled in patients on Warfarin! So I'd always recommend to patients that do not regularly eat these vegetables already (Broccoli, Cabbage, Brussel Sprouts) that they don't start eating them whilst on Warfarin.Just a little fun fact I thought I'd share. But yeah, unless they're on Warfarin (or another coumarin anticoagulant) then they don't have an excuse for not eating it!
I can see it now..It's like the fucking script for a post apocalyptic movie where there's like 18 people left on earth because, aided by super robotic exoskeletons, they've all eaten the rest of humanity.
Oh, the stories it could tell...
..I'm praying for asexual so no one at all has to suffer it's sexual advances.
Somebody should set up a scale/graph indicating the body types and appropriate designated ham name that it corresponds with

Oh look everybody its a hammy who this sub has offendedGive a fuck about your whining, I could not have pretendedThat anything you say and all the tears you shedDo anything but bring a smile, to my shitlord headWith it comes a poem that I am typing just for youOf course we're not perfect, but hey give credit when dueI mean to let oneself go and give up on good dietIs like ignoring medical advice, telling health to be quietTrying to shame us is a lost cause, have no delusionAnything you think will break us, is but an illusionWith a click of the mouse I ban you like a real tough guyMy mommy said I am, so trust me its no lieBut clearly you have salt that is stinging in tearsSo laugh at it we do with additional jeersSo long tubby or maybe just sympathetic Your attempt to get at us was pathetic

I'm not even really a fan of that kind of music, but I absolutely love "Is a Real Boy" great album. I really need to actually take time and listen to their discography
it's like the lure on an anglerfish
Someone always downvotes regardless, I swear it is the lurking fatties.
lol, I think he was in one of the starting cities, but it's ok. At least you didn't get annoyed that you couldn't teach that bastard a lesson.
You're missing the point. Feminist and egalitarian are synonyms, and while feminism might be kind of poorly named, they basically advocate for the same thing. It's about equality either way. It's just silly to denounce it by the name and incorrect connotations people have about it.
That last line. Reminds me of that Lord of the Rings scene. Putting it into the context of Tess using her HAES to defeat a shitlord. It's basically propaganda xD
I swear, if this kind of thinking spreads into the next generation's culture, we're screwed.
I thought 5'5" was average? Eh, either way, doesn't matter since she isn't seeing anna or needing medical attention.

Agreed. This one I have is aluminum and steel, it's super nice. Never had to sharpen the prongs, never even needed any maintenance on it. Worth every penny.
You know we still love you, we just have lives to take care of
I always make the mistake of assuming that fatties in the album are all the same person until realizing my error almost all the way through. I guess they all look alike.
We need entire fucking squads of shitlords and shitladies trained in martial arts to survive the apocalypse. The four whalemen of condishuns, fee fee's, EffYourBeautyStandards and entitlement are already upon us.

My whole family is fat. Me and dad are holding it down though....:/ It's not genetics either. Their idol is Paula Deen, sadly.

The only cat spraying incident I had was a skinny guy who paid in $2 bills. He was... strange. I hate the computers of people who chain smoke all day and do nothing but sit next to it. One was overheating (surprise) and I wasn't sure if a mouse got caught in the CPU fan or if it was tar and dust. He was a gross planet.

I just ate an entire 1/4 of a pineapple. I don't know how much that counts as "junk food", but it *does* have a lot of sugar.
I do hate fat people which is why I am here laughing at them. I hate how they are the embodiment of gluttony and lack of discipline yet everyone is scared of hurting their feelings. And it's true it takes a lot more resources to keep up their fat when compared to a shitlord. BUT all people that consume animal products contribute to animal farming, regardless of whether they're fat or not. Ick. Fat people and their jiggly jello bodies and their demand for burgers. :/
Cut off his dick and feed that to him. Then you can slice off his rolls and feed those to him. Rapist piece of shit fuckwad.
Reddit is full of fatasses
Don't clean-shame me, shitlord! I can do this entire pile of coke and still be healthy! Health at every drug-alcohol blood content!
But what if they are literally all titties and ass? Agh. No you're right.Honestly, I had to be drunk to sleep with that thing.
This ruins Outback for me, thanks. Now I can never have a bloomin' onion again.
My mom is ~60 and looks 35... If I put on 5 pounds as a kid she went all shitlord queen on me until I lost it :P
&gt;I think it would make more sense to set up public gyms that everyone could attend for free So who pays the lease insurance and staff? Plus building maintenance and equipment upkeep? There's the only issue lol
I lost it at"Fat stigma is a heavy burden to carry around"That joke can't be an accident can it?
Yeah, but how many hambeasts are living to be 75?
She already wasted her youth and life, she is only 23 and she will never get to enjoy it.
I completely agree. We are here to hate fat people, not tell someone who isn't giving any indication of an eating disorder that she is too thin. I am 5'7" and 116lbs. I've always been thin. My mom is 5'9" and has always been thin as well. I have a narrow ribcage, narrowish hips, and narrow shoulders. I'm just built thin. I desperately tried to gain weight in middle school and high school when teachers bullied me for being thin and allowed other students to suggest I had an eating disorder (when I was probably eating 3000+cal a day because I was so freaking hungry and playing competitive sports all year). Fortunately, my shitlord parents and doctor knew I was getting plenty of nutritious food (parents cooked every night - lots of lean protein and fruits/veggies, lots of good fats like olive oil and avocados, and very little processed food and junk) and was perfectly healthy. Sometimes people are just thin, and it's ok. I'll be happy to provide verification to the mods if necessary.
Same! I do treat myself from time to time but I account for it. I must admit I'm losing my sweet tooth. Dropping sugar almost completely from my diet has made it so sweet things (like regular cookies, juices) taste like...I don't want to say crap but I don't enjoy it like I used to. Well said, slippery slope. Sugary slope? :p
Wow, go mods
I think it's because they're clueless and just google the shit, or better yet, waddle into a store and let the salesrep have a party. Like, I dont' play videogames (don't hate) but my SO does, so I always look for "top 10 gaming &lt;shit&gt;" when I'm looking for a gift, read the reviews and select from there. Cause you know, gaming pros know better about gaming-related shit than I am. I assume intimidated exercise noobies are the same with sports equipment - discounting the fact that at their level they probably won't need anything "pro" for a while.
*"Normies"*. Now *that* is a term I havent seen in a while. Are you deaf or have any family/friends that are? Its a common phrase they use to describe the hearing population.

Came to say this. She was fat before just less so.

Well if that's the case then ps the big heads and big eyes and tiny necks and small feet, unless they're somehow REALISTIC PROPORTIONS. Come on, they can't even put effort into THAT?
Luckily they sell them in a handy single serving 18 bar packet, buy three, pay for two, at this rate if you don't eat 54 of them you're losing money. Your plaque plagued brain won't see if any different.Plaque plague. Nice

Everything that Bones says in that scene is shitlordy. One of my favorite scenes ever.It's important for context that everyone knows that Bones just told this lady she should lose weight because it puts her at risk for a whole slew of diseases.

Or so she says. I'd estimate 350-375.
Fatties: not even once
Hell no! Im still at school and I would definitely refuse to take haes classes.
Good to know you are ok.I too, once had an accident with a rather large lady. I was in the left lane and she was in the middle lane. I kid you not, we came up on a Taco Bell and she just decided she needed it RIGHT NOW.She turns left without looking and i drive right into her and push her to the edge of the road( almost to the entrance of the Taco Bell)She jumps out yelling at me but i was 100% it was not my fault so i stayed calm. Cops arrive and inspect the rubber marks on the road and plus a good Samaritan shows ups who witnessed the whole thing. Cops obviously say i have no fault and grill the fatty. As luck would have it, my car front was destroyed and her's was barely scratched.But good insurance and seeing her cry tears and plead the officers was worth it. Apparently this was her third accident this year and cops weren't interested.What i still remember as how her first action was to blame me and yell at me . Like these FF never take any fault for anything. Hopefully her insurances has skyrocketed to the pint she isn't driving anymore. Rather not have fatties hurting others.
Which va? Ann Arbor? Jackson?
Unaware of their terrible odor
Exactly. And homosexuality is never described as one of the 7 deadly sins. Being homosexual is not a "hell" sentence like everyone seems to think. It's just as bad as premarital sex, which 90% of people do anyways.
Only 8? I had hoped for much more.
I'm 30 and when 20 year old hams find out they try to pull the "You're old" card, since their youth is about the only thing they have going for them. A lot of good it does them, since they don't move as fast as me, can't keep up with me, and definitely don't look as good OR as young. Funny how that works.
This put a huge smile on my face.
&gt;I know this sub does not have a problem with fatties as long as they don't make stupid excuses and actually try to better themselves, so here's something to think aboutlol dumb assReported for making excuses for fatties
It's probably confused. :(
Fat chicks do play a lot of video games tho.
There was a 400 lb lardass at my old job. He would say stuff constantly like 'I can't eat this because my doctor told me not too" but would eat "this" and other shit CONSTANTLY.YOU AREN'T FOOLING ANYONE FATTIES.
Gotta love how she has no ass at all yet she's trying so hard to arch that back to pop it out, but in the end it just makes her look even worse.
What the fuck.
I have never been compelled to report for fat sympathy before this post's comments.
I need this answered
Can you tie em in a knot? Can you tie em in a bow?
I can respectfully understand the perspective you are looking at these types of situations from and I agree with your statement. I am not dismissing your statement b/c I agree with you. However, I believe the prevailing reason fat people get upset when they are denied what they want is because they have a very, very strong sense of entitlement that has become a learned behavior. We see examples of this entitlement all of the world (very frequently here on this sub b/c of its bias) with excessively large people. They demand federally funded programs to support them, they often refuse to work, they demand disability checks, and most recently with these FA and HAES movements, we have seen them demand they be socially accepted. In my mind, and I could be wrong or being biased, but demands are par with entitlements. I am truly curious to hear your thoughts and be presented other other reasons that could explain their actions.
You're right. Seniors tend to have more health problems because... well *seniors*.I don't think I've ever seen a morbidly obese senior citizen. I wonder why!
More proof we shouldn't let fatties breed. Sometimes death doesn't get there in time.
I don't know!!! But it's pissing me off! No one likes redpillers. They don't belong in modern society, and they should be auto-banned.
Real life chibiham.

Wtf. Why would anyone take fitness advice from someone who isn't fit? Is like going to see Pablo Escobar about kicking your coke addiction.
LOL! I'm using that McDonalds and Burger King line in the future. That's fucking gold.

Bingo. There are people out there who will get off on watching these idiots destroy their bodies even more than they have already, and these idiots are dumb enough to seek out such fetishists.
lol you posted this like 1 minute behind the other guy.
Ah, bless you. I'm better now :)
&gt;She's probably used to shoving people and things out of her way to be able to fit into an area.It probably didn't realize what its doing. Fatties exude a repulsive force, almost like an anti-gravity if you will, that exists in a greater amount than its gravitational pull. Sometimes, such as when they take in excess calories and add mass (okay, all the time), these forces fluctuate in relation to each other, and sometimes the repulsive force overcorrects, resulting in what appears to be the fatties clumsily knocking things about, but is really a spike in its repulsive force.Interestingly, the rate at which the repulsive force increases is greater than the rate at which its gravitational force increases, so the fatter it gets, the greater the disparity between its repulsion and gravitational pull. In theory, these lardasses could get big enough to rend the very fabric of space-time, which is why it is so important for us shitlords to stem the adipose tide.
I had to look at it twice before I realized BOTH DOORS HAVE TO BE OPEN IN ORDER FOR IT TO FIT THROUGH.If that doesn't tell you there's a problem I don't know what to tell you.
Kids can be the ultimate shitlords, me calling my mom fat frequently got her to start counting calories and get to a normal weight
I don't even think she spends that much time on it. I don't think planets are patient enough for that.
This is fatpeoplehate not foodhate.
Someone should start a shitlord dating site.

Wait, you're saying childhood abuse can't contribute to the development of eating disorders? The connection is pretty solid: in genetically predisposed individuals, childhood abuse lowers the threshold for stress-reactions. That is, the HPA-axis gets overreactive. The sympathetic nervous system responds to harmless situations with increased alertness. When distressed, you lose the ability to self-regulate. Physiologically, your body is prioritizing the elimination of threats. Self-regulation is an evolutionary luxury. This is modulated by serotonin. Low serotonin = low willpower. It's like a signal that tells you how safe you are and what your priorities should be. When you have an overreactive HPA-axis, you lose the ability to override impulses. The long-term goal of "avoiding high-calorie food" isn't prioritized, and the immediate goal of "satisfy desire for high calorie food" wins over.Mothers have an enormous effect on their children's stress reactions. For instance, through oxytocin amygdalar activity is reduced, which alleviates stress. A mother's love reduces HPA-reactivity. And what happens when mothers are stressed during pregnancy? Their offspring inherits their stress through an overreactive HPA-axis. In one study, researchers planted the fetus of a normal rat mom into the womb of a stressed rat mom, and the fetus became stress-prone. And what's worse, children born to stressed-out mothers gets predisposed to enjoying high calorie food more. The evolutionary logic is this : if my mother is stressed, this means there is conflict in the world, which means there is a shortage of resources. Therefore, I should really stuff my brains out when I get the chance. If you're really interested, the mechanism behind this is microbial: stressed-out moms have different microbiomes, so when they give birth to their child and vaginal fluid gets drunk by the baby, the baby inherits her microbiome. If the microbiome is poor, that's not too good.Childhood abuse can really damage your ability to self-regulate.tl;dr If you are abused in childhood, your brain adapts by prioritizing avoiding threats (immediate goals) over self-regulating (long-term goals). So when there's a conflict between short-term and long-term goals, those who have been abused in their childhood are predisposed toward the former.

Ugh, I just don't understand why people post pictures of food if the lightning is shit and make it looks disgusting. Why bother if you're not gonna do it right?
Yeah...I still think it looks kinda chunky though, at least on shorter people.
How many of those people are public figures though?
That butt looks like a bag of wet laundry.
1200 seems like it would be way below maintenance. Do you have calculations to back that up? Just curious, I'm interested in seeing if my numbers are off.

Fall &amp; spring I walk outside for a few hours as many days of the week I can. Summers I swim a lot &amp; anything outdoors really. Winter months I try &amp; walk a little bit, but due to the cold keeping me indoors I make sure I exercise every other day &amp; eat a bit less than the rest of the year. Generally I do a combination of indoor exercises; up &amp; down stairs, push ups, leg lifts, twisting mountain climbers, dolphin push ups, yoga, and anything else I feel I could use.I miss being able to go to a gym whenever I please but I don't have the money right now so improvisation it is.
I play significantly more games than my boyfriend does. If I overheard one of those lardbeasts EVER referring to me as a slut, I'd shove their shitty, unprepared, grease-ladden decks down their throats.

Writing from germany here. 1. Corporations producing the junk and governments for allowing it.2. Here the daily recommended value is based on 2000 calories for adults.

Adult fat camps too if possible.

Yeah the deep fried grease and sugars are the good things in life. /sarcasm. Forget about being able to survive long enough to watch your children grow up and be able to remain active with the. and entertain them during their childhood. Forget about being able to remain independent and be able to walk on two legs as you grow older and not suffer from all the pain the extra strain from carrying around all the extra lard, not that they will live last 40 anyway. Only the tasty fake processed food matters to them. Plus there are always Scooty puffs to move around in. They gladly let everyone else deal with the problems and effects caused by their weight. Selfish fucking tubs of lard is all they are.
Just leave them a good-bye donut attached to a picture of Homer Simpson on their porch. Glue it on so that they have to pick up the picture to eat the donut.

I don't think fats get much interaction with humans, so they have no idea how a real conversation goes.
Absolutely not. Can't stand the smell. Had some ex-coworkers though and it was a living hell.
Just seems like a bad idea to grossly (tee hee) influence young people with some of the more vitriolic comments on here or somoething. IDK, defending their tender minds, I suppose, is pointless because other kids can be much more brutal. Just my two cents.
Geez, I got a power rack, adjustable bench, 350 pounds of plates, a bar, and a brand new treadmill and I think I'm not even to $3k yet. Considering the treadmill was $1700 of that, my weight set cost a fraction of your setup :o

I can't eat a shit ton in one sitting during binge/purge episodes but I eat, puke, repeat 3-12 times a day so I'll go through a carton of iced cream over 3-4 goes. I couldn't fit that much in my stomach
Yeah, but he probably sweats chicken grease.
considering how much he is eating i would think he would be much bigger.
Allow me to shed light on this peculiar subject, good chap.You see, our colliqual usage of the term "FUPA" describes the hambeast's large, overhanging adipose deposit located below or around the navel.The mons pubis padding located on healthy human females exists to protect the body from physical damage.Thus, the mons pubis exists for a biological reason, and is protective of health. This is in stark contrast to the excessive, harmful adipose tissue muddled across the countless lardbeasts of Tumblrfats.
Some are elitist as fuck.
You basically described my life 18 months ago. And this stupid whore comes and makes fun of the hell I went through. Fuck that obese, ugly, virgin, pathetic bitch AND her followers.
That's what I hate so much about hams...they make it taboo! Wait a minute, we can talk about race, religion, and sexuality on the nightly news...but heaven forbid we address another real issue because feelings might get hurt.
I'm all for hating on fat people, but I really don't think this qualifies. A bit of underboob going on but that's nothing to be disgusted by. I doubt any straight male on here would turn her down.Bring back the real fatties so I can feel good insulting them on the internet.
Oh god just reading that made me need to take a shower.
BEST. EPISODE. EVER.
all of those self diagnosed "cundishuns" and just this paragraph makes her seem so cunty
Exactly
this has been posted so. many. times.
I do enjoy the seafood portions of Cajun Cuisine but I *loathe* high carb food and all the rice we use is ridiculous. And I WILL be partaking in my University's 10,000 pound crawfish boil. No wonder everyone is fat..
That's offensive to baby whales; which are adorable and also don't skinny shsme
Why the fuck are there way more lard ass fasionistas than there are fit and actually attractive ones. I *know* fit girls are kinky too but where are they at?!
&gt;Being fat isn't good, but I'm still a very sporty guy. So what you are saying even though you are fat you are healthy? Just get out, this sub aint for you.
You should have your mom make us some sammiches while we play D&amp;D.Your mom is so cool.
I hope they scrubbed their legs hard after that.
As a person who gets hired professionally in orchestras, this.
/r/TrueOffMyChest already exists
College is supposed to prepare you for real life. In real life, nobody cares what you did yesterday, how many presentations you had to do, or when you got home. If you are supposed to be at work at 9 AM, looking like a professional - you do it.
What they did to feminism really has a stick in my butt. I don't call myself a feminist at all anymore. Everyone sees/hears the yesallmen, "all PIV sex is rape", blowhards who just want to blame the patriarchy for their shortcomings. That's who the 'feminists' are in the average person's eyes. That's not me. I'm not a feminist if I have to follow that brand of feminism to claim that label. I was in college from 2005-2013 (no, I'm not a doctor). As goddamn embarrassing as it is to admit, my sociology degree took me 6.5 years (I was horsing around a lot, couldn't concentrate, couldn't focus... someone finally tried to test a radical theory that if my mom, brother, and sister all had ADHD and either dyslexia or discalculia... it wouldn't be surprising if maybe I had it too... That happened in March of this year.) and I spent 2.5 years working on an education degree before I just went nuts and said no more college. I saw feminism at the beginning of my college career, and the general consensus was something I could agree with. It slowly just became a pissing contest over who can be the raddest rad-fem. I can't say all of their ideas were wrong, and I did learn a few things from them... but I couldn't keep up. I got sick of being told that I was part of the problem because I'm a traditionally feminine girl that doesn't hate the fashion or beauty industry (hell, now I work in it!), or because I didn't see rape-y undertones in everything said by a man, or because I was a bad rape victim because I didn't let it define me (She's probably lying anyway- "Feminists" on my experience). Yep, I was done. I mentioned the bad victim thing to one of my sociology profs, who was an actual 1960s feminist. She told me that those people weren't feminists, they were just assholes. It still makes me angry because these are the dicks yelling over the rational ones who want rational things. I do believe that something needs to change with the way rape cases are handled, but I don't believe that every claim of rape, no matter how suspect, should blindly be accepted. I'm not "protecting the poor widdle menz", I'm advocating for victims and keeping innocent men out of jail. I have no interest in ever being pregnant or having a kid, so reproductive rights are very important to me, but I also think that a man should be able to opt out of his parenting rights if he doesn't want a child but the mother doesn't want to abort. I also think a paternity test should be required to put the father's name on the birth certificate. Nobody, man or woman, should be stuck being a parent if they're not interested in parenting. I think that we need more male teachers in elementary schools so that young boys have at least one positive male role model in their lives, but we also need more female teachers in science (my planned field, along with social studies) so that young girls can overcome the "science &amp; math are for boys" mentality. I'm a fan of single sex education because boys and girls typically have different learning styles and strengths, and focusing on only one style leaves the other group at a disadvantage. I also have an unpopular opinion about the sex offender registry, but I just realized that you said you have a headache and couldn't read my long rambles... and I just made another one. Adderall brain is kicking in haha!**The important part** is that I believe in an equal playing field for everyone. Women don't need to elevated above men and men don't need to be elevated above women. Men and women shouldn't be striving to have an unfair advantage over each other. Natural advantages shouldn't be seen as something one can wield over the other, nor should they be considered a point of privilege that exists to provide an easy target for baseless attacks on the entire gender.
Technically I'm sure it is a serving. Which is why they can claim it to be a 'healthy &amp; balanced' lunch. It's just a shitty way of including vegetables. Like when the serving of fruit is packaged in sugary syrup. Or that French fries qualify as a vegetable serving along with sugar-laden ketchup. It just creates sugar addiction in children, leading to fat adults who use the fat logic they were taught in school, like pizza sauce = vegetables and sugary smoothies = fruit.
And according to him its even *less* hot than that.Negative hot. Inverse hotness.
it pisses me off because some if these girls could be pretty if they lost like 200lbs.
lol. It is pretty gross isn't it?I think it kinda flows well with the ambiance of this sub
Because fatshits have fatshit kids.
&gt;Years of living with menI'm getting a sense that women fug the place up worse than men from some of the stories on here. Maybe the descriptive abilities of the shitladies writing up the stories are more powerful but I've read at least three stories on here that have made me gag. I have never read anything about the men's can that has been so disturbing.
You little.. you little PURSY
Isn't it funny how she hasn't had jeans in years but, its literally not because she got up and made the effort to fit in a pair. Rather she stayed dormant than haes showed up and now they have companies that create size 60 jeans.
Hey, if I wanna help someone with thin privilege than I will! It is my right as a shitlord to do so!
She went from cutting to carving.like a Christmas ham....get it?...hello?...Guys?...is this thing even on?
Nsfw tag. I literally cannot fathom how anyone in the health industry is remotely overweight. That is like being a car crash investigator and not wearing your seat belt. It makes no sense. I have been sick lately and went to the doctor today and thank all that is good in the world I had a nice thin older nurse, a hot skinny young nurse and a thin wise female doctor treat me. I just can't buy what a fat healthcare provider is selling.
She is basically a couch.
They did, but it never grew. It's as if the death of the original will prevent the new fatpeoplehate from growing.
Check his account.
He looks like he's the copyright-infringement-avoiding Elwood from Poppyseed Parkway.
Don't you mean losing soda? They don't drink water
Is this not a joke? Seems like joke.
It pisses me off when hamplanets put fat acceptance quotes to her.
It's a shame about that personality though.
I abhor the word diet!!! When people see me eating they ask if I'm on a diet. My default reply is "No, I just eat properly". It *is* a lifestyle, ffs, there are no miracle cures.
Seems to be a description relating to food snobbery. People who watch cooking shows from celebrity chefs, like to eat at the most amazing or off the wall restaurants in the city and blog about their lunches that they style and Instagram too. A pile of wankery related to food.
Criscodemon, it's a cacodemon and Crisco.
After I took the pic, I noticed the shelf signs could be his thoughts floating around. Thoughts of shitty, shitty canned food.
o.o :3
Not sure about the reasons why, but my cousin who has Aspberger's would only eat a few things when he was a kid. Mostly PB&amp;J sandwiches I believe. However, he has always been really thin so...
Don't forget all those vineyards. Someone's gotta keep all those wino housewives on the wrong side of 300 lbs
No it's not :( More like MRA/Redpill with a hint of neckbearding.
Alternative if you live in an apartment/don't have ready access to dryer: stick it in the bathroom with a hot shower going. Hello giant garment steamer.
I'm surprised he didn't try to hit on you for being asian.
fat Asian women are very rare...I like the Asian way of doing most things
Hear, hear! I agree with this decision. This bullshit should be bumped to a bannable offense!
Fatties are full of envy, and his wife commenting on your abs was most assuredly seen as a threat to his chubby manhood, however innocent it may have been. For all you know she's probably not attracted to her tubby hubby anymore and they could be having marital problems.
That makes this post infinitely better
For real, how do they fuck?
What kills me is that it's like we're not eating healthy because we want to be healthy/thin for *ourselves*...Oh no, I'm only doing this because I need to be an exact ideal of what *someone else* thinks I should be. WTF? I'm my own biggest critic and I do NOT want to look at my body and not like (for the most part) what I see.
They are probably thinking they are entitled to free Pepsi since they are on a Pepsi plane.

They're just practicing intuitive exercise!
Completely agree :(
Sometimes I think that there is a Ra's al Ghul out there trying to cleanse society. Instead of through violence, he and the league of shadows are pushing FA and HAES in order to weed out the simple minded in order to bring about a new world order.Brings a tear to my eye how beautiful a world full of only gorgeous people would be.Edit: grammar
No no, those things don't matter, the divorce rate is practically 0, she can just be a mommy forever!
As sick as this sounds, I think they're jealous of anorexics. They're jealous of their skinniness, and the concern and care that they are rightfully given in order to help them become better. Don't people realize that all the attention belongs to them after all?And they don't like the fact that they get called out for lying about it because the DSM is very clear on the criteria. But they want the attention, and they need it as an excuse for their own lack of self control.Edit: A word.
4'11" 95lb, I have done this. Brownies are my weakness.
Now she's going to go "reward" herself with a trough of ice cream. ^TeeHee!
Yuck!!!!
your date looks hot though, style wise.
The way they eat I'm sure they're used to having turds of similar size constantly shifting around 24/7.
Personality can't make up for being revolting.
Anyone know who SFW 3 is?
&gt; I'm a ham planetDamn you're making it too obvious m8
I'll never eat cottage cheese again. Eww.
Ah, want to be part of that.
Where do they get the confidence to leave the house like that?
That story on the side stays the same no matter what pic you click on
Guy that I used to go to school with drove drunk and ended up hitting an old couple while on their morning walk. His friends told him to crash at their place instead of drive but he decided to drive. Two people lost their lives and he's in jail for life.
BMI of 24.9 is the cutoff, unless you're muscular.
Is it though? It looks like she's with him.
Dude..... NSFW/ NSFL
When I was a little kid I loved sucking on pennies, so nasty when I think about it now.
Nah. The mod ones are suppose to be obnoxious &lt;3
I'd cut back on that, can't be good for your heart.
Let's get a little perspective: The most important thing is that this British teen didn't have her feelings hurt by a poster.
Pretty sure I'd have PTSD and everyone knows you turn into one of them once you have been traumatized /s
"My grandmother died of a heart attack, but it was caused by her dementia" uh can dementia do that? "She was perfectly healthy except for her liver and her kidneys" and the dementia. Not really what perfectly healthy means. "But that was caused by her pills....seven pills a day" bitch seven pills a day is cake walk. Also I call bullshit that both her kidneys and her liver were destroyed by just seven medications and the two doctors plus the pharmacist failed to realize the deadly over drugging.
The only thing wrong with a fat person is looks all of a sudden?You must be new here.
Haha, her plan has been foiled!
Don't mean to be rude, but according to some sources online her height is 6"2/188cm and her weight is 163lbs/74 kg. That's a BMI of 20.9...
I would feel so shitty about myself if I was the fattest person in the exercise class and I was the instructor!
shut up
I think most women might react a bit differently as a whole compared to men, maybe they would rather find excuses to leave the date or something similar. But I wholeheartedly agree with you, and I think it's unfair to say that you're shallow if you don't want to go on a date with someone who catfished you.
These types of dresses are so pathetic. Its obvious what theyre trying to do.
Alive . Stupid prank is all , she had no idea .
The dumb ones? If any of them had any intelligence they wouldn't be whales.
Big of you to admit it. It gripes my ass when hamplanets act like their actions don't effect anyone else. Yeah, right.
I know I might get some shit for it, but goddamn, the worst place I ever traveled for work was the southern USA. And Texas was its own special flavour of disgusting.
You know they actually wanted to write "10 pounds of shit", but mud isn't bad.
I'm a verified shitlord and I'm all for loving other shitlords, but telling girls that are already skinny that they still have fat to lose is perpetuating the really horrible ideas that cause girls her size to become anorexic and is really fucked. That girl is a good weight. She weighs at most 115 lbs. I'd fuck her.
Banned for finding something in a fatty attractive,
it's cute teehee
Absolutely. It should. It was probably created during a time period where people were much more active in their daily lives, and it needs to be readjusted to account for the decrease in general movement and activity.
&gt;THEY COULDN'T HANDLE A REAL WOMAN ANYWAYWell, that's true.. my spine couldn't handle that.
It's the Peter Griffin effect, or "dick do" disease - "My gut sticks out farther than my dick do".
I can't help but notice how much nicer she looks without the punchable expression on her face and the horrendous make-up, hairstyle and clothes that she is now "famous" for.I mean, she still looks unhealthy, yes, but at least she doesn't look like an unhealthy person who is also a horrible attention whore and wears the expression of a mercilessly retarded dugong
Man those SJW are such dense motherfuckers. Yeah, please walk around being proud of misandry, that'll help the feminist cause and totally not feed the fucking MRA nutjobs.
Good question! And just to be clear, since there are some conflicting definitions on the comments from those who have responded before me, here are the definitions:Vegan: absolutely no animal products. No honey, no leather, no milk, no cheese, no butter, no meat, no ice cream, no eggs, etc.Vegetarian (me): no meat. I eat dairy and eggs. I am an ovo-lacto (eggs/milk) vegetarian. I also consume honey and I use leather. I use leather for utilitarian reasons, mainly because there's no adequate vegan substitute and my purchase won't have an effect on the overall demand and market for leather. But I'm certainly in the minority, because very few vegetarians use leather. Also, it's true- some vegetarians don't eat eggs for philosophical reasons. For one reason, if you can get farm-fresh eggs, sometimes you cannot be certain that the eggs haven't been fertilized. But I'm not a life-begins-at-fertilization person, and I'm not here to talk about politics. In addition, eggs that aren't free range have very questionable farming practices. For example, even cage- free hens live sad lives. Again, I'm not here to proselytize, I'm just laying down the arguments. Edit: just noticed another comment. This one makes me angry. THOSE WHO EAT FISH ARE NOT VEGETARIAN. FISH HAVE EYES AND A PULSE. FISH ARE ANIMALS. Those who eat fish but no other meat are called pescetarian.How we get protein : I'm a tiny female and I consume around 80 grams of protein a day, so that's good enough for me. One basic way is to use protein powder. Vegetarians can consume whey if they want to, but I don't because I'm picky about dairy (simply a personal preference) and I don't favor the taste. Instead, I prefer pea protein, flax, or hemp. Mixed with almond milk, it's pretty good! I also take three supplements: B12, D3, and omega oils. B12 converts food into energy and it's readily available in many veggies, but I'm always concerned I won't get enough, so I supplement it. D3 is in dairy, I believe, but I don't consume a lot of that. Finally, omega oils are great for the skin and brain. Finally, we have to make complete proteins, which is not too hard! I am a huge fan of carbs for protein and I don't try to limit the amount of grains I consume, so I might not be representative of the population. Whole grain bread and pasta are high in protein. Add beans or spinach or kale and you get a complete protein. Quinoa and oats are also protein packed. Yogurt and cheeses are good too. Beans and peas are fantastic. The list goes on once you start exploring bulgur and chard and things. And then on the other hand, we rarely lack vitamin C or A, which come from colorful things like bell peppers, or my beloved apples.Sorry for the book, but I'm always excited to answer this question! And as you can see, if you don't pay attention to what you're eating, you usually won't get enough vitamins. Also, the guy at your office kind of sucks because he should bring his own lunch instead of bringing the whole office down. That's the general rule. Another edit: also, tofu's a good source too, but there's some questionable sentiments surrounding it. For example, soy can mess with your hormones and ultimately modify your DNA or act as a free radical and oxidize in your blood. I'm not a doctor, but it is enough to scare me away, so I avoid it.
The sad thing is when homer gained weight to 300 pounds for disability is only a small fat compared to the ham galaxies running around today.
That mental picture, perfect.
More and more I'm having a feeling that fat people are like little kids.
Don't let that fatlogic in here... Small fats are fat.
I live in a largely (teehee) Hispanic neighborhood and I see people crammed into clothes like this all the time. Comfort is one of the first things that pops into my mind - how the fuck does she breathe! God forbid the dumb bitch has to pee...ya know unless she's comfortable with laying on the bathroom floor and digging pliers out of her purse to button up again.
I think the 110 weight minimum is because our bodies have less blood and if they take a whole liter it could be detrimental to our health or our body's ability to replenish what was taken. I cold be way off here, but that's my assumption. I know I even get lightheaded when they take 6-7 vials of blood for a full work-up.
yeah I think this chick would likely be a fox, if she wasn't two people walking around in a body built for only one.
You need to be verified.
You can get electrolytes else where. I think eating a few peanuts would do it.
shame 'em n pinch 'em!
I liked it in my edgelord phase, then I realised it was a bunch of 12 year olds out-middle-schooling each other.

I don't think being gay means you like the opposite sex. I'm pretty sure it's that you like the same sex...
I'm a size 4 and I'm curvy. This is discriminashunnnnnn
There's too much of it.
Well, you can tell this post is getting more popular on /r/eddit because it's dropped from 3k likes to 2600, lol. Bring it on fatties!
Umm, sometimes we joke around about tumblerinas who take it too far with the gender labels, like "genderless semistraight pansexual demiboy", I know the meaning of these words, semistraight I made up of course, but I think most shitlords are educated on the meaning of many of the terms people use, it's just confusing sometimes when they use too many, or 2 terms that are pretty much the same or sometimes the opposite. I like the word "pansexual" for example, being open to the possibility of being attracted to someone regardless of gender, but if I started talking about how my life is so hard for being pansexual and started bringing that up in every conversation it would be annoying.
Here's where I think you're wrong. I think a lot of them are compulsive eaters and don't even fucking know it. I think probably about 50% are deluded about how large they actually are. Once you've convinced yourself of that, then the blinders go on, and everything is genetics, cundishuns, and large amounts of corn syrup.
Do PM me as well please!

I don't know if you've ever had your blood drawn, but it's not a terribly thick liquid. Fat people blood is "almost like chocolate syrup in consistency" according to my mom
McDonald's is not making you fat. Eating too much McDonald's is making you fat. Have some fucking personal accountability, fatty. Geez.
Ordered mine today! !!! Question please respond ASAP what size did you get? I'm 6'2 195 lbs but a large might be to big.
I hate it when I accidentally put my head on upside down.
Non fat milk is shit. Just cut the sugar and order the whole milk. It's much healthier - as long as you're lactose tolerant of course
OP, fat people love diet drinks. It gives them less guilt for eating more fatty foods.
Exactly. That would make it more satisfying for me, prolonging her shame.
Exactly. And what's infuriating is that the teens, AND their parents AND other teachers support those negative ideologies. Highschool and university are so concerned with holding hands and singing about their feelings that they miss out on some important shit.
muh privilege!
They can't see the URL when I connect over SSL. The URLs are encrypted. They can block based on IP adress, which they can see in the IP packets, but they don't see which subreddit I'm on.
Why do you put up with it? I sure as hell wouldn't. It is one thing to be respectful to a fat person in public if they are respectful themselves, but once they insult me or someone else, the gloves come off.
They're like little chicken wings. That can't be comfortable but I suppose she doesn't do much walking.
So here I am shovelling salad into my mouth, visiting FPH for shits n giggles and promptly got the urge to puke everything out cause I imagined a fat guy forgetting to use the toilet for so long he busts open and *poopcomesoutofeveryholeohmygod*Yeah I think I'm done eating atm
I instinctively stood up and checked my legs. Kind of like how in dreams you aren't totally sure if it's real, but you gotta wake up to find out for sure. Fuck letting a human body go like that.
Thank you!
I have nothing against reading the fat hate here. I find it supremely entertaining. I'm just saying that when I go out and about on the streets, I don't have this all-consuming negative cloud of emotion due to fatfucks, the way they seem to think we do. We aren't obsessed with them like they make it out to be. I'm intending to stand up for us, not for the whiny whales. ;)
Your husband is a fucking genius. And he is obviously a keeper!
I used to be able to stomach this kind of shit. Not any more.There's a reason that lawyers try to keep parents off of juries for cases like these. My son turned 4 last week. I'd push the lethal injection plunger myself, on both of these animals.There is *nothing* worse that a human can do than torture a child to death. Nothing.The Euros on reddit love to preach about the barbaric United States and our barbaric death penalty. When I read this, I prayed these two monsters lived in a death penalty state. They do. Let's hope they get a fraction of what they deserve, and that is to be put down. They have demonstrated that they are not fit to inhabit this earth.
true you need protein but when you are starving the body does not waste as much protein for things such ascellular repair and such which is one of the reasons your skin begins to look unhealthy, etc. this is also why wound healing takes longer if you're starving or lacking in protein.
An outfit made of just no and the lost ability to even
Considering booze makes you feel stronger than you are this could be a lose lose for some.
Aw man, I guess I'd have to go back to stripping.
True chubby chasers/fat fetishists annoy me because I think they're sick in the head, but I'm told that I'm not supposed to think that because it's fetish shaming or whatever.
Ah, I wasn't reading the entire mod list. Your name is still on there. I wonder why TPW changed his mind and brought you back.
I recall reading about obesity's effects on life expectancy and the general number was that it reduces life by 10 years. That's generous compared to what I was expecting, but if any redditors have other info it would be greatly welcomed. I cannot believe that this lardball can potentially live beyond 40 at her rate of consumption.
this fucking gluttonous pig makes me sick, i never even knew who she was until i found this magical sub but god dammit i hope her heart just explodes next time she tries to stand up. how is this pig famous and getting praise for being healthy!!!
what sort of question is that even for a non-fat person?fat must be pushing against his brain
The pic said " I like this and I'm not sure why" I immediately thought "do you like pork?"
It's amazing that they think spending hundreds of hours on hair and makeup is going to distract us from the sweaty gelatinous mountain beneath it
Always remember that we have Ellen Chairman Pao and her SJW friends running Reddit. They can brigade anything they "feel" is wrong and nobody can talk back or you're fucking shadowbanned. Fee-fees are ALWAYS more important then facts.
Wut. I can walk four miles in an hour with a bag of dog food. They're not even trying
And black person(a) make up (rounding up) 13% of the USA population but commit 70% of the violent crimes doesn't mean we can say all black people are violent

yep
I'd keep your reddit-browsing and your professional life separate if I were you (if this is real).

All-in resorts have nothing but bored guests who don't visit the country they're actually in so they need people to constantly entertain them.
That statement says more about you than it does about them.Congratulations on keeping your immediate environment free of filthy obeast warpigs!
A fucking men!My mom had us ride bikes with her while she ran, and after we were able, we started running with her too. It was fun to us and we loved it. She also took us grocery shopping with her and taught us proper nutrition. THAT is how you parent.
Looks like a 3rd degree burn
"Because i fear the day they finish the worlds suply of maple syrup" Well i now have a new fear, and a mew reason to hate fat people just that much more.
Please don't! If you don't become a violent idiot after a few drinks, the likelihood of anything bad happening is very low, the likelihood of you having a great time is very high!
Meh, I own my typos.
She's cosplaying the Grimace, who I presume to be so lumpy shaped eats nothing but McDonald's.
Let me rephrase... Even one is one too many. I met quite a lot when I was in and they're human filth.
That and she now has a fat wrinkle on her forehead.
If "curvy" is delusional... Well then she's very curvy.
Implying that a fat has ever heard of micronutrition...
Even on my desktop I kind of skimmed it (taking a break from work, gotta hurry). Appears to be about a fit, thin girl having fat friends and taunting them every chance she gets such as eating junk food like they do yet being considerate of calories, etc.
GOD DAMN ALL OF THEM. I really can't handle roadies some days. Dude, I work here. I can carry the equipment, they wouldn't be paying me if I couldn't. This would be literally the worst job ever if I needed a big strong man to help me every time I carry something larger than a pencil.
Just like watching a graceful swan :)

Well that was her "pre breakfast" so i imagine it happens pretty quick eating like that.
Good luck!

FUCK OFF, FATTY!Also... good job. : )
Nuts in a more American scale: 1/4 cup is about 170-190 calories depending on the type of nuts. It's easy to completely kill your daily calorie count with those.
Yeah caffeine can apparently help to lose weight, but not if you chug it with 150 calories of sugar.

There's a fast food restaurant called Habit?There's definitely a joke about hambeasts' bad eating habits here.
Should also be noted if you didn't notice that me and Neko are both mods so we know that.

Fifty Shades of Gravy
Okay, I clicked on the link...this is the first time a fat person's face made me laugh. The first thing I thought of was, "Princess Downsy."
Yeah but the truth is you're not gonna find a lot of fat people who *aren't* hypocritical. Even if they try to hide it in the beginning, it'll come out randomly, which is why I just hate all of em.
So I am a small guy (5'-7" 135 lb), and it's nearly impossible to find clothing that fits in the store. Even the small size at most retailers is too baggy and is obviously made for fat and short people. At 5'-9", you are exactly average male height in the USA, so why should a medium not fit? I guess it's because they have to make clothing for the customers, and the majority of them are overweight or obese.
Thin privilege is a waist measurement that can fit in a 5-bit unsigned int.I wonder if the super obese have a circumference over 64 inches.
If you really fuck up they ban you from life, with no chance of re-spawn.
Thank you for this literal LOL. I like you.
I dont know why but I read that in the voice of jeff dunham's jalapeno on a steeeck.
Find that hard to believe....
As much as I hate SJW's, I have to agree with this. The confederate flag is a blatant symbol of racism. Despite what the more educated rednecks say, the confederate flag is not about small government vs big government. The confederacy fought to preserve slavery and to protect their belief that blacks are lesser beings suitable only for manual labor. The confederate flag is as much about small government vs big government as the swastikas is about rebuilding a country after harsh, postwar stipulations. So yes, the confederate flag is the american swastikas. It is a symbol of our radically racist past and should not be celebrated by anyone who claims to be educated, independent, and/or not racist. If you flaunt the confederate flag, just admit that you're either ignorant, gullible, racist, or all of the above so we can move on.
Everything the government does is by the lowest-bidder. It applies to doctors and nurses salaries too.
She's a ballsack
You're doing the good work! I especially like the groaning noises while you push them uphill. I have no advice, just a pat on the back.
He was shaped like a rectangle a really wide rectangle
Touche.
I used to drink a lot.Not enough to find fat chicks attractive, but a lot.
:'-)
Yes. [They're hilarious](URL
Fat people really do deserve each other.
Probably ate the whole container then "changed her mind"
&gt; BTW, why are there no big memorials to the dead white Christians murdered by the Bolsheviks and Soviets in Russia and the Ukraine?What proof do you have that these things occurred?
Yes fatty, assume position. Now try a push-up.
It must be tough. Please take care of yourself. Always prioritize yourself first.
True, but he's far better than the fat fucking ham planet next to him
True story: My wife wears men's clothing and keeps a short haircut. She's very tall and slender, often gets mistaken for a dude, and she's okay with that. She looks very stylish in a suit.She refuses to refer to herself as a butch lesbian because it's almost always in reference to an obese lesbian who dresses like a truck driver.
Quickly. Before it eats you
To be fair, she is quite short (around 5'1) so the weight gain looks especially dramatic on her...although I really don't know anyone who could put on such a massive amount of weight and "carry it well."
Here's the difference between me and fat fucks.If I saw a post where someone was asking for an overweight partner or said something like 30+bmi only. I would read it and just ignore it simply because its gross. Fat fucks will be fat fucks.But as soon as an in shape person lists a very simple and realistic standard, they get shamed and picked apart like a plate of brownies in front of Tess Monster. Makes me sick
So stupid. I have 0 money and today I bought 1 pound of chicken breast, bell peppers, onions and pita bread for fajitas for dinner. Total? $4.06What can I get at taco bell for that? Garbage.
And he still is feeling guilty towards himself after a girl "he" dumped TEN YEARS AGO. Wat.
So you're saying it would be a mental/psychological transition issue, not physical?
It's even making Pikachu on her T-shirt look defeated.
They actually get more food in a bowl. Once purple started realizing that, the fatties really jumped on board
I might at some point. Though, I honestly don't really know why I would. Thanks for the compliments though!
Your entry test is not fair :v My BMI is 26.1 because I hit the gym twice a week, not because I eat like a hippo.
Yes. The biggest concentration camp in europe was already being built in Austria when the war ended. That camp could theoretically kill half a million people per day, and it was being built to kill all Slavs.
they look like 10

Too bad faggot.

I dont think so at all.
He's actually disgusting too. That much muscle is horrifyingly gross.
No, If anything it would be one of those overweight hens that does nothing all day and only lays 1 egg a month...
Her eyebrows are perfect.
Why did they give her 5 chances... Navy was 3 consecutive and you're out. And that is still too many.
It's like watching hammies at an all you can eat buffet...at closing time.
There is a sense that people related to each other can treat each other like shit and it's okay.Fuck that *Days of Our Lives* bullshit.
Lol. Good op
Or "healthy at BMI&lt;25" cause one size is impossible for everyone to conform it because of height.
&gt; What a bitch.*fatwhalebitch*
A cocktail napkin...
Smallfat exists because the disgusting reality is that there are far too many people who waddle around with an extra 300 lbs on their frames. Because we are a society that judges by comparison instead of individual merit, we get smallfats. We get idiots who think they're better/not-so-bad because someone out there is worse than they are.I agree with you, btw. I'm just pointing out the reason of smallfat. :)
She just messaged me saying she lurks this sub. THE FATTIES ARE AMONG US.
Make sure to check the sources. Sometimes the links are dead or misinterpreted.
Then don't go to r/popping! It's a magical place filled with more things like this!
&gt;I can give you over a dozen names of friends of mine who died "healthy".Jesus Christ!!! Why do this guys friends keep dying? Possible explanations:-He killed them so he could eat them.-He sat on them-They were so repulsed by his appearance that they gouged their own eyes out and inadvertently died of blood loss and/or infection.
My friend is obsessed with that fucking TV show of hers. It's terrible. Absolute shit.
That might be it then, all of my experience is touristy port cities.
I was born without collar bones.And here are people that actually have them, and want to accentuate them more.Triggered.
Muh Condishuns!
It's not illegal to *have* them, it's illegal to *apply* them.
No problem! In that case I'd definitely look into hopsack blazers with patch pockets and a ticket pocket. The SuitSupply Havana is a great option, but if its out of your price range you can use it as a model for other similar jackets.
Whenever a product I want is sold out, I can't help but wonder how many fat chicks got to it before me and are now wasting it on their fat faces.
Whoa!
You edited that shit in snap chat didn't you? lol
Lying puta should. It says it's "vegetarian" (or some shit like that).
Consider this. The taxes collected on the ridiculous amount of food they purchase could perhaps counter their cost on society. Maybe they're even trying to drag the country out of debt by just buying every morsel of food they can get. THEY'RE the.patriotic ones! We're the bastards for consuming only what we need!
Sure, but it ain't fat so I'll give the benefit of the doubt.

Be careful what you wish for. The gulags await all fatties, fast-lane hoggers and Jets fans.
I'd love that. People need a good dose of shaming, the problem is those people also vote. I'd have to run on a platform all full of fee fees and then totally flip the script once I take the oath lol.
No, my feelings are fine, you actually hurt my brain tho with you absence of logic!
I would absolutely report it. Is the ham ACTUALLY disabled? Maybe, but forging a physician's note is not okay.If the only disability is "obese" then the city should refuse to grant a bus pass and make the ham walk.
haha look how far he has to lean back just to not topple over under the weight of that fuckin gut.
I've been doing this since grade school as well, mostly because I was always almost missing the bus in the morning so no time for breakfast and I was given $2 a day to buy lunch but... at 13 an extra $10/wk is a lot of money!I didn't do awful in school (I am a software/firmware engineer) and I am not at all unhealthy.
I wish they would put up posters like this in medical centers. Switch the dog to a fit human catching a frisbee.
That's atrocious, it should take around 30 minutes to do 5K and that's being generous.
They have haven't they? I moved home after a few years away and everyone is a lard based sack of tracksuit, I'd never seen the obese at home on mobility scooters till now, I thought the Irish had more pride.
Big boobs don't count if you're a fucking hamgolem
I'm surprised that your words are legible seeing as you are undoubtedly mashing the keyboard with your sausage fingers.
There is this little thing called 'academic integrity'.I don't know about you, but I don't want my doctors or nurses to be cheaters who slid by on meritless extra-credit bullshit.You know what's harsh? Disciplinary action for professors who facilitate cheating. I don't give a shit how big of a shitlord OP is (OP is probably a fatty/SJW trying to bait gullible fucks into giving up their anonymity anyway), cheaters and their ilk need to be canned, permanently; one strike and you're out. That's the way it is in the real world. OP is a piece of shit in my books.
Seriously, how does that guy wipe his ass?
Did she actually GAIN weight during that year? I had to double check the date stamps, because I thought she accidentally put the "after" pictures on the left.
I keep expecting her to roll-up like an armadillo and roll away.
Your comment basically just said "yeah, I don't know"
well the national guard is regulated by each state (ex: Texas national guard, Missouri national guard, etc) but their modeled after the regular army and can be federalized so they can deploy in times of war. But theyre pretty much just like the reservists to where they only work one weekend a month and two weeks per year. If your active you thats your job/career, if your a reservist/NG your mainly part time. Full time if war breaks out.
It is interconnected, though. A lot of the other industries depend on agriculture, and vice versa.
But cardio is good bro you can't just completely cut it out
I'm 142 pounds, 5'6" (Yep, 3 pounds down from lowering my daily intake and removing midnight snacks) and I have low stamina.I was also born with a heart condition though. My point is, I'm extremely unlucky.
No I believe it is possible for her to be 240lbs... 240lbs from the overweight category
For breakfast I ate a third of a meatloaf and yet for some reason I was still able to go for my morning 5k... Muh cundishuns are so triggering!
I mean, there's no need to thank me! I'm just a lesbian in very much appreciation of my girlfriend's beautiful breasts. I'm sure there are many guys out there as well who appreciate perky and beautiful busts over large and saggy.
I disagree.
Best username
This pleases me to no end.
Can verify. Previously commented on kicking a fatass out last week.
About how much weight you think she had to lose to have to get this kind of surgery? I'm kind of baffled/interested in the whole loose skin thing in general because some people just seem to have little belly/tits bits and some people have this shit. Is it like a LOT of weight? 100+? Just my morbid curiosity, haha.
Ok, was just wondering how your timing was so prompt
I think it was a stationary bike? I don't really remember haha. But yes the point still stands
So she's not one of those blobs?
Thats the dream. I have a POG friend and the shit that I hear about in that trade, I would pull my hair out and just beast the living fuck out of the butter golems
She does at least have a better chance than some to figure out what to do. She can see the problem, and even the echo chamber won't be able to keep their bullshit ringing true. She's peeked behind the curtain and won't be able to unlearn what she knows. She may go into denial a while longer, but maybe she'll finally go shitlord.
They forgot to blur the rest.
They're just mad that that's their next destination.
No, I didn't create this collage. This is how she posted it. I was browsing a certain hashtag on IG, and this was one of the results. Unfortunately I don't have an Imgur app on my phone, so I took this screenshot from my desktop.
Nothing wrong at all with having a food scale to track your macros. Everyone should have one.
I wonder how this will go..
Unless you have some sort of time machine, I think saying what is going to happen in 20 years is kind of silly. He could go down as one of the greats, he could be forgotten about. I could see him getting a lot bigger than he is now.. hopefully bigger in popularity and smaller in mass haha.
I did it and it said 25 year old male. Not sure how it got 25.
I'm not good at telling who has had lipo and who hasn't... I wasn't even aware the pic I used wasn't photoshopped.
tl;dr the video: URLThe main challenge you have to overcome is realising you're not a fucking child anymore and if you want to NOT be fat, you must NOT eat when you're unhappy, as that only makes you more fucking unhappy and fat.Two years later and I can barely tell any difference between boogie2988, when you're that fat, that's just fucking embarrassing.
Active in hating fat people, tall-ish and slim for a man. Mostly the fact that I don't know too many guys around that BMI who aren't runners, hikers, cyclists, or climbers. "Assuming he's an endurance athlete" would have been a better phrase.
I don't know why there's so many fat nurses. Been trying to figure that out for a while... When I'm on shift, I barely have time for lunch, so I usually just have a meal replacement protein smoothie. I have no idea how these cows even find the time to get to the size that they do.
No nose ring.. shocking given the state of rest of it
where can i watch this?
Sounds about right
I would love this but my entire family is fat. Fuck.
It is. A 5 minute mile is still damn fast. A 6 minute mile is respectable. A 7 minute mile is...well, it's there. And an 8 minute mile is...Not braggable, let's just leave it there. Edit: I don't say this as a fitness snob, I say this as an inactive fuck that can still squeeze out a 7 minute mile on a bad day.
They're probably custom made.
Basic statistics is fat shaming! How dare you expect 340lb BBW curvaceous women of size to do extrapolation and not 100lb anorexics? Discrimination!
I agree. They're not dying fast enough.
Yes.
"Parting the moose knuckle" is one of the more repulsive sentences I've read this week. Have an upvote.

That's sad, she's already fat in the first picture, but she could have *easily* turned it around at that point... the second picture, well... pretty much just a dying whale now
When it all comes down to it, the SJW movement pisses people off the most by mistaking consequences for discrimination.
WTF
They are still here. Probably eating pizza and wringing their fat, greasy hands at the comments here. Have a good weekend, you disgusting blobs! ;-)
what anon said.
Last Sunday, I sat through a presentation with a box of donuts within arm's reach. There were way too many donuts there for the number of people present, and they were my favorite kind (long john donut master race).I had one. *One*. I could have destroyed that entire box... fucking long johns are so god damned delicious... but I *didn't*. Why? Because I have a measurable amount of will-power. Adults don't consume an entire days worth of calories in *donuts*. It's just not a responsible thing to do.So I had my one donut, and that was that.
Guess the gender.
Ha, some people have a relevant link for every occasion.
A bit, I'm calmed now!

Any names on those places? How are they even getting the names of the user base here?

Nice try OP, but that shit just doesn't faze me.
plus she wasn't gonna let go of the double cheeseburger she was halfway done with while writing the note
I'm 6'4", 200 pounds is just under being overweight. 5'7" and 200 pounds is obese.
No, as you can see I use both terms in my comment. I know some people who get offended by being called disabled, but we don't all.Differently-abled is just more all inclusive, in my book. Some of the people at the gym I go to, which is also a Paralympic training facility, are fucking amazing and can do more things than completely able bodied people can.Like this guy Bob who is basically just a torso. He can fucking drive, play sports, and he's got the most rocking six-pack. I'd never call him disabled, he's just abled a little differently.Just my choice of a term though.
It's fine in moderation, but it's very high in calories and a terrible primary protein source.
you are right. he is fat. ITT: delusional fatties
Clearly he must be hitting the calf raises pretty hard at the gym.
Its a fire safety hazard. As much as a shitlord that door is, it shouldn't be there
There is just no way this tees cuntster is only (only....) 120 kg. I hav a cousin that was 120 kg and no where near this big. If she's fat and proud y lie about her weight?
Didn't they ban whale fishing world wide?

&lt; This is the perfect example of "fat."So to clarify: even though you literally just labeled him as fat, in a sub that is called **Fat** People Hate, he should not be mocked for being fat?I wouldn't call myself an unintelligent person but I don't follow the pattern of logic.
Ask him why other people eat those things and remain slim.
How imagine her thought process."hurr durr, not my fault, it's mah genetics!" *flips off photographer*
Lol a reverse tourniquet.

I'm super grossed out but also impressed...

She doesn't want to feel guilty for catfishing people."He trusted that I wasn't a fat chick, he was asking for it!"
That's a real possibility. Certain genetics could come about to accommodate the surging plague of obesity. I also fear it will get to a point where fat is so normal that it's accepted as beauty. It's on its way there now.
What is the crusty stuff in its hair? Why would you not wash your hair and just trowel on makeup like that?
To be fair, fat people in general are less gender-specific. They're just blobs.
The fatties and HAES adherents remind me of religious fundamentalists. Always claiming to be the oppressed while attempting to get the whole world to change to accommodate them.
To be fair her huge nose and double chin actually make it look like a ravens beak.
Neck fat. Obvs as fuck.
Wheymen, brother!
I imagine for competitive eating you would want to maximize your bodies efficiency for calorie consumption, being fat really doesn't help your bodies ability to digest things ironically enough.
She jelly.
I left at the same time as her and I saw her pull out a milky way out of her bag before leaving. I mean cmon.
Dafuq did I just read?I was under the impression that the term FUPA was derogatory in a shitlord-y way...y'know...making fun of the fats.Makes me wonder if she called it for satire/irony, or if she's just that stunned and doesn't really realize WTH she's talking about.
This is Atlanta. Fat for a big city, but the slimmest place in the South. She's also on the Beltline, a transit option here *designed* for shitlords. She needs to get the hell out of our city.

I think he said he's under 500 now, but was 550 at his heaviest? At that weight, he has to be careful about his exercise, but he can get into a pool and just move around. It's amazing how many calories just moving at that size burns.
Sounds like you're a fatass, gtfo.

As someone who is actually *in* a wheelchair said on this sub, if paraplegics could diet their way out of a wheelchair or Walmart-scooter like fatties have the option to, they'd do it in a heartbeat. The three rules are a lot less strict than the guidelines Type 1 diabetics or people with celiac disease have to do in order to stay alive and healthy. If it's so hard to not feel hunger for a Twinkie or something, change your diet to something that will make you feel full so you won't feel a craving for it--ask /r/keto, for example.

Wow, this is actually infuriating. What does it hope to achieve by making a face which half looks like it caught a whiff of its own body odour? By far the most punchable face here. I'd punch it but I'm scared my fist will just get stuck in that thick goo of a face.

A feeder. She hungry for num-nums
Hey, she has fought in many glorious battles! Like when she yelled at McDonalds employees in an attempt to get free food.Or, maybe she's a spoiled, delusional fatty who has never face real challenges in her entire life.
You know, I'm a tall willowy shitlady, and because I've always been attracted to Asian men, I mostly ended up with guys shorter than me. Height never bothered me, my Aunt told me that tall guys like tall women and short guys LOOOOVVVE tall women. I've found that to be true. And because I'm not particularly materialistic as long as dude is smart, funny, attractive and has a job that HE is happy with, he is in the running! So fat chicks hit on your 9/10 dude? I'm telling you girl times have fucking CHANGED! In my day, fat women would have considered themselves lucky to make it to the mailbox and back without a shitlord "mooooing" at them...but nowadays they have the fucking MOXIE to hit on a slim, good looking dude....WITH shitlady on his arm. Fat must totally fuck with logical thought processes methinks.
I'm pretty sure the eyes are just contact lenses. Still, it's not a good look for her. Makes them look even smaller compared to the rest of her face.
Oh! Snap! I'm a sad man, boy you got me there pal! I'll up vote you for that one because I take pity upon your poor, misguided soul and I know nobody else will be showing you that kind of kindness. Its funny you think they are the most hateful people out there when YOU are the one posting such hateful comments on a page and subreddit you know all to well the nature of. It shows how pathetic of a life you must lead, when you actually go out of your way to irritate and enrage others with your intolerable lack of knowledge even remotely relative to this subject. Instead you use the old reliable standby of bringing up what you read from a textbook or hear from the mouth of some self proclaimed "scholar" of this subject. Why don't you just do yourself and everyone else a favor and stay off of pages you intend to cause trouble on or ones you know that piss you off. Because you are only pissing me, and everyone else off by acting like an idiot. I truly do believe that you are better than that and can understand the complete and utter uselessness of such an act.

Yes! Hating fat fucks with science!
~~distracted thinking about~~ Eating.
I have virtually the same** measurements as her, and yet i get doxxed and brigaded and called a skinny bitch... Wtf** my hips are uneven, so I am 5'5" like her on one foot, but not the other. While we have the same bust measurement, I have a large ribcage with smaller boobs. We weigh the same, have the same waiste size, same hips.
where are those abs? rad (red) thighs? from chaffing? all in all yucks
I would hesitate to even call it a 'trick'. Unless you are referring to her size, similar to that of a pony. Haha. The quality of the majority of other comedians was great, but there will always be a couple of bad ones.
I don't have the flu, I'm going to vomit

My ex-wife went through ups and downs with size control. When ever she starting gaining weight I'd point it out and ask she do something about it. The last time she gained weight she flat out refused to do anything and it was up to to put up with it. It wasn't the only reason I left, but it was high on the list.

some of these guys have better curves than I do.
Fatties love corsetry. It makes them think they look thin. They don't.
I hate fat people so much... So much. I eat junk food all the time and I'm in shape as hell. What's so hard about not being on a goddamn Frappucinno IV drip and just being normal? Yeah that's real adversity: pigging out 24/7 and being a lazy over-indulgent fucker. Oh wait, that's hedonism and gluttony.
They bigger the cups, the more they will drink, and the higher is the risk of a heart attack.

Hey, my name is Cassidy, that is what caught my attention! What is this a reference too? I vaguely recall my grandma saying something similar. Just... not a fat joke.

What's the betting her depression comes form her lack of fitness and overall unhappiness with her body?I am saying that purely based on the majority of the other hash tags she used. She may be depressed for another reason but that's the only thing she's pointing to.
Yeah, it's a kink where one person gets off on gaining weight (feedee) and the other gets off on making the other person gain (feeder).I'm not one to kink shame but what the ever loving fuck.
No you are right, I was on a mobile and formatting is a pita. Basically he told me that HE should have told her she was getting fat before it got so bad he couldn't touch her.
With their fatlogic at work, they'll just do both anyway. Repeatedly.
Is this a man or woman?
13 may be 25 and like to rage with his friends, but he looks like a dead 50 year old.
Appreciated!
If you don't like the way we do things, then what are you doing here? Fat is fat. It's gross, no matter what.
We are out there, among the fatties. Just harder to spot.
My cousin is disabled. She has never walked and never will, probably without robotic aid. She's still not an eatbeast. Disability does not equal inability to control yourself. Also another cousin gained an insane amount of weight due to medication. Turns out that wasn't the case, she let herself go and recently turned herself around and is an average shape again. She also has legit mental problems so not sure why anyone needs an excuse to be obese.
Thank you. I didn't want to come across as...fattie.
Disney has a few water parks and there are ALWAYS hams in speedos. All lobster red from the sun pigging out on food they brought with them. Its great to watch them stand in line for a water slide and climb all those stairs only to be told they wont fit! Haha. I have a story of a lady actually getting stuck and had to be lifted out with a crane.
Me too. I actually like a hazelnut latte with soy milk. The flavours compliment each other nicely.
&gt; Nah, hashtags are a good way to connect with people who have similar interests...You could say this about interracialcouple, too. Actually, compare it to the other hash tags... Some are just worse like the whole fat acceptance shit. And some like couple and love is too unspecific to really connect with people who have similar interest.&gt; ...for example fitness and stuffWhich was none of those hash tags.
Regarding underweight BMI, I think it starts 18.5 just because that's the point where people start to get health problems from being too thin. I'm not sure anyone would disagree that a 5'11" 133lb man is skinny to the point that it limits function a bit.

my GF sent me a pic like this last weeklike an abused dog, I automatically cowered...it took me a few seconds to realize they were normal shapely legs, not wanting to harm me, but wanting to reward me. this is why i need fitacceptance. because i shouldn't cower when i am presented with nude or scandalous photos, i should embrace them without fear of thunderthighs.
I want to hop on the hate train based on this comment, but I don't believe you. Let's say $5 (high) for a hot dog and $10 (high) for a beer. That would be, split evenly, 1500 beers and 1500 hot dogs. And $822 on food PER DAY for his family? It's just not possible. If you had a source...
You know you reached next level obesity when your cheeks become concave again despite gaining fat.

Left exactly two years ago at the first signs of jimmies abuse and sympathy for the defiled....fuck that place sooo bad. It used to be so much fun before it got big. I'm glad FPH has retained some soul despite the growth.
Ugh. Ew. Too bad, though: anyone who got there voluntarily deserves to suffer (and gag on) the under-fupa stank.
I saw this guy on Nevermind The Buzzcocks and he seemed funny so I decided to check him out on Youtube. This was the first video that I watched and after hearing his comments on how the BMI is wrong and wanting doctors to use a different word than obese to describe him I decided not to search out anymore. No thank you, I don't really want to listen to stupid fat logic when I could look up more attractive Buzzcocks panelists instead, like skinny Matty Healy.
That's how I use the term. Someone who is slim but no muscle.
I have no idea what this guy is talking about, honestly. I'm a woman, 135 lbs, and I can easily carry my own weight on my back for quite some time ^(have given many a drunk friend a piggy back ride home from downtown). I'm not some hugely buff motherfucker either. You'd have to be pretty pathetic not to be able to carry someone your size or smaller on your back at least for a little while.
If you hate skinny women then why are you trying to be skinny?
I believe zero about that tale of fat "persecution"
it never ceases to entertain me that when hams get fat enough they literally form hooves from the pressure of the excess weight
If they want to serve that market they need to be prepared to do so (fat scooters that can hold higher weights, bigger chairs, etc), my issue is the little old lady hobbling around the giant store because Fatty McLardass is riding (and breaking) the scooter. I'm all for stores making money selling food to fat fats, but not at the expense of those with actual disabilities.
I posted this on r rage before and got turned because I said he was fat or something lol.

I guess it is nice that his sister and mom are supporting his hobbies.
Really, this works on any marginalized group or unlikable people. People who don't get treated well in society. The same strategy works wonders with rude and entitled customers. It can be difficult to swallow my pride, but I'm a talented actress and it's worth it. The only downside is that they become attached to me and request to be seated in my section every time they come in. But loyal customers are good tippers, and I'm a professional, dammit.

They don't grasp the basic principles of the scientific method, and I doubt any of them actually sat down and read about it to begin with. The people who are quickest to judge, doubt and bash science are those who have absolutely no idea how it is conducted.
Hopefully it was the coroner.
She's not wrong.
That is actually a very good comparison. I myself used to love being a hacker, but now its a dirty word.I love figuring out holes in software, or the occasional prank on friends, but I always send any bug I find back to the devs that made it with the steps I took to fix it.Now however, if you say hacker, it's likely to get people worried about their bank accounts, social networks, and their online games. It's stupid.
I'd be a bit cute about it and say something like "oh usually people compare me to a steak" then grin and say "hmmmn....what food do you look like?.."
I'm so so sorry guys. i really am. If you need someone to kill you so that you never have to see that again, we'll do it together because if this is what HAES wants then thats not the type of world I want to live in.
Watch the interview with the owner, the guy knows exactly what he's doing and doesn't give a fuck.

You violated Rule 4 - No Linking to Other Parts of reddit.
I think of obesity as a symptom of overeating caused by addiction. It is of the same brand as smoking/drug addiction.The problem is that it's not recognized as such and thus people get away with it, "Accept" it and can pass it onto their kids.
I have no idea why. But I'm irrationally angry about this response.

Yes, but that muscle is not actually in the penis, but at its base, and is also responsible for bathroom control. Kegels or whatever the male equivalent is will make ejaculation more intense and give you more control but won't make the penis larger

as someone who does do drawings of anatomy a lot, i do find the proportion of her ribcage to her pelvis a bit odd. but it may be due to her profession i wonder what she does to have that muscle distribution its very interesting.just a weird side thought.
I love you, and I love your boss.
How can I get into distributing these? I'm charismatic, tall, attractive, and muscular so the hams love me. I'm also entirely ruthless about separating stupid people from their money.
They "only" go up to XL?! That's like saying this car will "only" go up to 250 miles per hour, or the ice cream parlor "only" has 40 flavors to choose from. Extra large people and extra small people and everyone in between can buy a shirt that fits. There really isn't much to complain about when it comes to the range available.
And what's the ridiculous shit about America and American food? Hello, Swedish fatass, you are in Sweden, so you must be doing something very very wrong.
This is what frustrates me: that there is no set way to do things because everyone thinks they are correct. Show up 5 minutes early and some tightass will mark you down for not being 10 minutes early. Show up 10 minutes early and a different tightass will mark you down for hanging around before you are needed. I suppose then the only thing to do is what you think is right and hope it meshes with your potential employer. It's probably a good thing in the end to work for someone who is on the same wavelength.
It gets better the older you get. It's so great seeing all these guys just let their bodies go to shit and having a ton of female attention by sheer virtue of not having a gigantic gut.

[It has to be:](URL* More than one-third (34.9% or 78.6 million) of U.S. adults are obese.* Obesity-related conditions include heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer, some of the leading causes of preventable death. * The estimated annual medical cost of obesity in the U.S. was $147 billion in 2008 U.S. dollars; the medical costs for people who are obese were $1,429 higher than those of normal weight.* Non-Hispanic blacks have the highest age-adjusted rates of obesity (47.8%) followed by Hispanics (42.5%), non-Hispanic whites (32.6%), and non-Hispanic Asians (10.8%)* Obesity is higher among middle age adults, 40-59 years old (39.5%) than among younger adults, age 20-39 (30.3%) or adults over 60 or above (35.4%) adults.

It's not her fault she voluntarily moved into an apartment with a door that doesn't fit her, and opted not to renovate it to fit her enormous body. Kind of like how it isn't her fault she's fat to begin with.

"In the last year alone, three of the doctors I work with have been significantly injured while treating severely obese women. One even dislocated his shoulder while performing a cesarean on a 400-pound patient"
You are correct in that statement. However, I also have the politeness and courtesy of a human to not go up to someone whom I find unacceptable and tell them that they look "gross." Instead, I let them live their life, at least publicly, and move on.I was moreso trying to make the point that only fat people go up to fit people and say ewww, that's manly and gross and who wants to look like that?You don't see fit people commenting on fat people's instagrams (unprovoked , too often) saying was you are a giant plum. Who wants to look like that?
Shit I feel for you. My best friend had to get special bras, because the plus sized store stopped carrying bands smaller than 38. She's also a 32/34 but was resized to H. I can't even find 30. I think that would be a better fit, because at a 32, I'm on the tightest closure. I know, go to VS, I just moved near a mall that finally has one, so in a few pays I might take a trip.

Well, I guess you're fortunate enough to work with the 1% I was talking about. My experience with fat people is 4 things: denial, insecurity, ignorance and bitterness. Sure, there are a few who don't fit into that stereotype, but far too many do.
Frequently in Southlake. The women are mostly trophy wives. Anywhere outside the immediate area? Fat city.
I'd rather let it rot.
True, and homophobia. But I'm pretty sure pedophilia is banned site-wide anyway.

She's going to take that bite. Spit it out out. Drench it with ranch. Then resume eating. Aaaand then have a pizza.
Which is why HAES is what it is. They are literally attempting to change what it means to be attractive. Bad news for them, can't revers millions of years of evolution.

Is this real?
Where do we draw the line? Someone eating a salad or walking a little more? This isn't tee ball. Not everyone gets a participation trophy. Diets fail because fatties think it's a temporary thing. If they make it though 6 weeks of salad they can get back to burgers and fries.Real life isn't going to appreciate them trying. A fatty will still develop health problems at 250 just like they will at 350, 450 and higher.Fatties want my appreciation? Get your BMI below 25 and keep it there for longer than it took for you to get to landwhale status. Make a real lifestyle change and not a diet. This is fat people hate. We don't celebrate those "trying". We celebrate results.
That guy pisses me off less than real life fats, RL fats use their fat logic to justify their shitty lifestyle, this guy is ok with being bashed, and he just happens to prefer breakfast and whatever to being healthy and attractive.
Oops, made a mistake, she won the second series.I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a clearer example of how weight is a huge (hur hur) factor in music. She was the clear winner, had a great singing voice. Yet when the dust had settled, and Michelle's obligatory hit was sold... that was it. The music industry had no interest in promoting a fattie singer when Pop Idol, as is X Factor, was all about finding a good looking, healthy, talented singer to make as much money as possible.

I have... a secret dream... of getting a kickstarter campaign to offer several of these FA personalities $10k+ for a month or two of either monitored eating, or ideally, a monitored diet, where they *only* eat what they claim they eat (or a selected diet). After that month or two, if they've maintained their weight eating what they claim, they get the $10k or more. If they exceed it by a significant amount (25% or more? up to debate), they get Jack Fucking Shit... My gut says... the drop a fuckton of weight if they stick to it....

I didn't notice the 'Photoshopped' CamoFat until it was pointed out, now I can't see anything *except* the horrendous shopping she(?) has done. It's everywhere!The back of her arm, (the one with the tattoo of what I assume to be a portrait if Dolly Parton but I still think looks more like Princess Di), is so obviously whited out but it is done so badly she actually looks more lumpy and oddly shaped. She would have been better off literally using Liquid Paper or TippEx on a photo. Its awful, my 13 year old could do better.I have spent the last 10 minutes looking closely at Tess M's attempts to CamoFat her shape. I feel kind of grubby now.

It was a treat, but that's the key, it was a *treat*. Not normal food. Thank you mom and dad for raising me right.

She was dating the same guy all through high school and even a bit after we graduated. So my guess is that she tricked herself into thinking that she'd still be sexually attractive to him if even if she gained a little weight. But a little weight became a lot of weight and people like this fail to realize that part of a relationship is being sexually attracted to the other person.I know married men get "wife goggles" sometimes after you marry someone and you both start to age. But wife goggles are supposed to be because of aging, not weight gain. Everyone ages and that's not something any of us can help. But not everyone gets fat. It's not normal to just balloon up as you get older and a lot of fatties seem to just ignore that.

An mri would cause a pacemaker to stop working (as most pacemakers have a small magnet in them) and/or could heat up to the point of burning the patient and/or could carry an electrical charge and shock the patient.   The magnetic field strength for an mri is generally measured in units called 'tesla' and the 2 most common mri Strengths are 1.5 T and 3 T. This means that most mris are AT LEAST 1500x stronger than the earth's magnetic field and some are 3000x stronger.   An open bore one like the one in ops picture would generally be less Strength (0.9 was standard open bore field strength a few years ago) and some mri magnets used purely for research are 9 T and higher.  As far as I know there is a fairly new kind of pacemaker that is shown to be mri safe on a 1.5 T scanner but at my hospital we don't scan anyone with a pacemaker (not worth the risk, they can have a cat scan.)  I'm sorry for the goddamn novel I wrote.

I saw a documentary that presented that fasting makes you live longer. Everyone should watch Eat, Fast, Live Longer by the BBC. Basically, fasting lowers IGF-1 in your body. Lower IGF-1 levels means lower to no risk of cardiovascular diseases*, cancers, and more. Also, fasting has been a part of us evolutionarily so much so that when fasting new synaptic connections are created in the brain. Why? It heightened our memories so we could find food, to survive. &amp;nbsp; '* dwarves(?) found somewhere in Ecuador who had little to no IGF-1 didn't develop the same illnesses their family members developed. Scientists found they were virtually immune to (most forms of?) cancer, diabetes, stroke and more. They all live(d) the same. Eating crap and sedentary.
It's an invasive species unfortunately. Semi aquatic creatures who spend ample amounts of time putting on blubber for unknown reasons. Scientists have yet to conclude why exactly they do it but from observation these animals are literally killing themselves by overeating. Perhaps evolution has taken place and these animals no longer hibernate but the primal instincts still kick in. Several Groups argue that these animals are healthy though

Honestly, even if something seems so stupidly obvious, there will always be some idiot somewhere who tries to refute it. That's why they do these studies. I mean, look at the whole HAES movement... they clearly need these stupid common-knowledge studies, right?
You know people ask me all the time why I eat super healthy and exercise...its not to look good at the beach...I do bodyweight exercises and cardio. I could care less how I look to other people...I maintain a healthy lifestyle for my kids and myself...does it sucks sometimes...sure. I would love to eat a bunch of bullshit, its cheaper, less time consuming and easier, but I dont. It is 100% a lifestyle choice. I am sorry about your friend but I dont think you should feel like an asshole, its true, much like adduction to drugs and someone overdoses, addiction to food and a heart attack are the same thing. People can stop doing drugs just like people can stop eating too much bullshit and bad food.
Horrible if true and the full story, but this is from The Telegraph, which is a bit like if the Tea Party ran a tabloid. Be skeptical, be very, very skeptical.
Unfortunate: having or marked by bad fortune; unlucky ... I have to disagree, luck has nothing to do with that orbital body shape
Oh fuck that's calories, I was reading kilojoules
It's a joke. Gender(same thing as sex) is binary.
I grew up Catholic and during Lent they taught us eating meat on Fridays was a sin (don't get me started on how ridiculous the religion is). So, there would be a fish fry on Fridays and people would eat deep fried cod from who the hell knows where. This rich, decadent stuff was fine, but a lean turkey sandwich sent you on a one-way ticket to hell.
Might be fit now, but gradually that HAES/FA mentality will creep up.
Not at all. Apparently I'm a cunt for pointing out that there are plenty of men willing to do fat chicks.
That nose roll
He looks like he now had his moment of clarity. Like "hmmm maybe stuffing my face every waking moment of my life might not have been the best idea."
So did you have the vagina to tell her to shut the fuck up, or are you just so passive aggressive (read COWARD) all you did was take a picture and post it here? Please tell me you told her to fuck off.
I think instead of pictures of pigs, infographics of the dangers of obesity using Tess images. If anyone who Google's Tess Munster/Holiday finds the top images showing the dangers of obesity and obesity related disorders over the top of a Tess image, it would have a far bigger impact, or if anyone Google's "pre-diabetes" or "obesity disorders" finds infographics featuring Tess.
Looks like someone filled a Stretch Armstrong with floam.
What is it with substitute teachers always telling their life stories?Typical fat-fat "I lost 2 pounds, praise me for it".

I've been poor enough that a smear of mayo and a bit of brown sauce(yes this is how desperately poor I was i resorted to using brown sauce because we had it in the pantry) on a piece of white bread has been an acceptable lunch.

It all boils down to the fucking belief which follow;&gt;if you can't say something nice, don't say it at all.And that feelings and opinions have any value in general communication. They do in personal communication yes. When I'm shopping, I do not care how you feel and it's exceedingly creepy when people I don't know mention or ask or whatever how I'm feeling - doesn't fucking matter.Certainly don't force meanness onto people, but do not ever filter yourself because it could be mean, who gives a fuck?
Pshaw. You youngsters. I grew up in the 80's, when your jeans had to be so tight across your pelvis that the only way to pull up the zip was to lie down and use a coat hanger to pull the zipper up.
Her thinking is all about appearance and health just gets jammed in there. She is now getting tons of attention that feeds the fat logic. "You're so beautiful!" to her = "You're healthy and gorgeous even at your size!" That's my take on it at least.
Oh mighty neckbeard!
I hate when people do that, and also park in the handicapped spaces. I'm pregnant, and also have a toddler, but don't even use those spaces. Mostly because I don't look pregnant and don't want someone yelling at me....and then there's people using them because they're too lazy to walk. :/
Looks like a small fat making fun of large fats.

Lol, you're missing the point. The point is *fat people are gross*.
My first thought! Who wants to see Dr. Phil roll her away?
it's so disrespectful the way fat people think they can deceive everyone
And, it's hysterical in a bad way.Guess what happens when a politically favored group or organization or government over there ventures into something monstrous again?If you speak out and criticize it, *that's hate speech*. Their speech laws are and will be a protection for vile people doing vile things. The EU has its share of very shady matters they do not acknowledge in discussions like those shown in the imgur album.In fact, if you brought up various evil stuff done there - organized crime, political crime, abuses of justice systems, participation in and economic benefit from military actions/conflicts/wars for which the U.S. gets sole blame - they would likely claim you are engaging in hate speech.Think of Rwanda in the 90's. I remember in high school when the Rwandan genocide was happening. The OJ Simpson trial was constantly in the news, but Rwanda was overlooked. Now, *that* was annoying, sure, but what was really enraging was how the **U.N. refused to acknowledge the massacres as a genocide.****The same international organization which these SJW's hope will straighten out the U.S. is the same organization which is known for evil deeds like looking the other way while a genocide is happening just so they don't have to take action.**I'll take being called a bigot day and night by dipshit clowns like them. If anyone asks me, the U.N. and the international system of NGO's connected to it lost all status and value in the mid 1990's. They are all discredited. The same U.N. that still tries to prosecute people who go dabbling in Holocaust denial.

Almost everyone is my family is big,as well. I HATE when I see the 12, 13, 14 ish girls who clearly need to lose weight and parents not doing anything about it. At this point I feel some people think weight gain is a normal part of puberty! My mom is 55 and she has health problems that I know she would likely not have if she lost weight. I have a really good friend who is only a year younger than her but he is slim and fit and you would think they are years a part in age. My mom complains of aches and pains and issues that she would not have otherwise. I remember her slender. I don't know what happpened. Even if someone uses life as an excuse to pack on a few pounds (like 15), how does one continue until they are like 100+ pounds over weight? In my family they claim genetics. I guess I am a mutant. (nope I just watch my food intake workout)
hahahaha that's why you're so upset you continue to come back? Oh god this is too good to be true. Piggy's jimmies are rustled as fuck.
Holy shit. Goals.
This is an affront to those of us who actually put in the time and effort to achieve fitness.
Is that... a mobility scooter.. for underwater? Oh my.
Damn, was catching up on this last Sunday's episode and saw this scene. Good thing I did a search before trying to make a gif of it.
I can't even
If it makes you feel better, most likely this lion had to be put down because there were too many males in the reserve. This lion without a pride would try to kill a rival male and all its offspring. So instead of just shooting it themselves, the reserve auctions off these big game hunts and uses that money to support the reserve. They do the same thing with rogue elephants. The animal is going to die by being shot no matter what. Might as well make some money to preserve the program.
It's so she can spew twice as much HAES/FA shit

The associated thread (in the TIL subreddit) is one of the most rage-inducing experiences I've had in the last few years. There is so much fat logic being spread. This is why we are needed. We have to dispel these myths.
When someone questions the ingenuity of the human species this is going to be one of the examples I use to prove how great at problem solving we can be. If science can find a way to fit 1100 Calories into a pint we can definitely solve any crisis.

Thanks!
You're not going to know what hit you when you start dating a shitlord and get banged six ways from Sunday.
Actually you joke about it but in all seriousness, when I used to work in an office, the fat Linda's as I call them did the same thing to me. They talked so much about my weight (5'4 110, slim but nowhere near anorexic) and spread rumors I was anorexic. To the point where I didn't get a promotion because my boss questioned my health. Now I couldn't prove it of course (that the health/anorexia thing was linked) BUT don't fucking underestimate them and the damage their shit talking can do. God I. Hate office hams
I was honestly prepared for a flawless front handspring, not really sure why I got my hopes up
While they completely ignore the fact that the latter comment infers that they actually are ugly anyway. But fuck it, any praise is good praise to these fucking animals.
The female George Costanza right there.
But... World famous athlete. I don't know of any real athletes that are morbidly obese.
don't blame me, the mods did it to crank me.
I do, actually. The joys of the obnoxiously fast metabolism are a beauty.
So, is that a 40 inch waist? Assuming 20 inches is zero?
Ha, I misread the @ thing on the third picture as "casketogram." Pretty fitting, because that's where they'll be soon if they keep it up.
Yup
Very well put by your friend. Too bad the fatties will continue to stay deluded that /effyourbeautystandards is actually empowering. It is just a farce that a few fatties started to make some money. I know that losing weight can be difficult but I love this sub because It cuts through the bullshit. Our society can continue to coddle people for creating a disability and using it to milk the system. If a person is going to eat like shit and treat their body like shit I think the government should do the same to them.
That is literally why this sub exists.
Drake the type of nigga that thinks it's okay to be fat

Their TDEE's are always well over 2500 calories. The idea baffles me.
Makes you wonder where their bottoms did go. Filthy fat fuck.
Look man I get it, Sweden Yes, but this serves no one. Instead you could submit a post raising awareness on one of the aforementioned issues you raised. Something that has weight. If you had an archive of the op in this post, it would go without question. But this stock photo and weird url arn't concrete. Its sensationalist. Good propaganda doesn't need to lie.
A fact which is amazing when they are inundated by so-called American "culture" and products. Japanese simply don't buy into the bullshit as easily as westerners I guess.

Reading this only pisses me offOne look at that fucking whale and you can tell she isn't healthy by definition of the damn word!Beaty maybe in the eye of the beholder (she's an ugly dog in my eyes) but health isn't I don't give a shit if she has confidence or people call her beautiful but do not expect me or anyone with a brain to say she works out more then once a month, if she did she wouldn't look like the whale that ate Ahab

Holy shit, she's only 29! I thought that bitch was already in her 30s....fuck if you're right that means we still have to put up with her for another 11 to 16 years :(
That's exactly why pictures of fat brides and grooms marrying normal people make me so angry. Marrying someone with an incurable terminal condition is one thing. There's something beautiful about two people being so in love that the pain ahead is worth sharing the remaining time together. And it's as amazingly beautiful as it's amazingly disgusting for someone to CHOOSE to make their spouse a widow. The death of a spouse, with or without kids is pretty close to the most painful thing one can ever go through. And he's happy to force that onto someone he claims to love if it means he can keep eating cookies. I can't even imagine how it'd feel to realize that someone you married values a cookie more than he does you. And it's not like it's even an all or nothing thing. He just has to eat LESS cookies!
At least she didn't make the whole street smell like bacon.

My friends mom also has a degenerative disease affecting her muscles and joints, primarily in her legs, and was wheel chair bound when we were around 10. She would still play catch with us (she would use a big bug net to catch the ball if it went over her head which definitely contributed to a lot of laughs) and would do cool stuff like play Mr. Fox where she would use the hose to 'catch' us instead of chasing us. Hilarious stuff and just goes to show how fucked up fat people are. They have the physical ability to play with their kid and just won't - fucking up the only body they have when someone with a disease like that would gladly trade with them just to be able to PLAY WITH THEIR KID.

How do I get verified? If it needs photo I'm gonna have to wait a couple of weeks for my gf to get back from visiting family for Easter and use her phone as I don't have one or a camera (can't even get a contract cos when I was poor I fucked up my credit rating so slowly working it back atm).And now, I'm just preparing for second year exams at uni and fatwise, I'm like low 20s BMI and probably around 20 BF% (no idea tbh and the pics don't help) so admittedly not great but I'm getting there. I'm getting properly into running atm and reckon I will be able to start adding volume within the next couple of weeks. edit : The bot has shown me the way and I will do so soon : ) Also, I don't eat fast-food anymore, haven't had literally any for a few months now although I am partial to the occasional takeaway curry (aren't we all?). Other health good news since you're asking and I'm currently procrastinating from work, not smoked for nearly a month and not smoked weed for half a year or so.

Miranda Kerr. I love her body.
Came here to say came here to say this. Thank you
Everytime this ham said she KNOWS her body, and KNOWS she won't lose weight, I wanted to smack the donut out of her claws and tell her she's a fucking liar. As that shitlord doctor on Insight: Fat Fighters put it, everyone can lose weight- the blatant 'but I'm different' attitude is so maddening...

Meh. I have an older sister who I like to call "Karen Three Pools" because that is about what she as cost me in the past decade. At last count it was a little over 200 grand I have forked out for various rehabs, jail visits and as of about a year ago a car accident -- which is impressive because she lost her license after 4 DUI's 8 years ago.When she is not shoving drugs or alcohol into her morbidly obese body she is I guess at least a little better off than this chick because she is shoving meth-head dick into herself. So ... there is that. Yeah, these people exist. You don't get to pick your family, which just fucking sucks sometimes.
And that's fatlogic for you.

I agree with you in principle, but really, this woman runs a flower shop. Did she open the place to not sell flowers? That said, you are right, of course. But she doesn't advertise the place as "Flowers for Straight People." The Muslim restaurant wouldn't advertise pork, would it? She's just an obnoxious fatass looking for publicity by being controversial.

Oh snap, you beat me to it! Shitlord minds think alike.
Honestly you will get a lot of flack for it. Now everyone is about social justice and acceptance for everyone. In this modern "Everyone is a winner" world if you choose to dislike anyone you are shunned.
I agree about the eye for fashion. Day to day fashion is about dressing well within the bounds of what's acceptable. Everyone at my office wears chinos and sport shirts or dress shirts, occasionally slacks. So that's what I wear. I just focus on fit, color, and getting the details right (which is what's difficult.. especially with pants. Don't get me started about pants for people who squat. Ugh).For what its worth, all mens jackets should be tailored. All of them. Just factor it into the price. At a minimum, sleeves altered and waist nipped in. Also, 99.9% of men look better in a jacket, and most people won't think twice if you're wearing one. Its all about getting the style right. An unstructed cotton jacket can be worn on the weekend with jeans (or with shorts, if you're the "go-to-hell" prep type and have the confidence to pull if off) or at the office.If you're curious, the reason men look better in jackets is simple - division. We naturally find men more attractive and aesthetic when their body is divided into thirds... But most men's legs naturally rake half the body. The button stance on the jacket divides a mans body into thirds, making it look stronger and more refined. The lines from the shoulder to this point give him that inverted triangle as well.
There are some things you just bring up.
What game is this??
I don't know about this. I've never felt like anybody wanted to kill me because I've criticized the mainstream Holocaust historiography, or pointed out evidence which has been ignored. When doing this, you don't need to shove your conclusions down people's throats. All you can do is provide information -- people have to make up their own minds.
Well, one of them is thin. So 80% is overweight. Isn't that close to usa overweight people %?
Fatties indeed do that, but in this context it was about the body builder with very low fat %, so it wasn't about being fat. Someone said that the body builder had the lowest fat % in the world, which isn't true, because there's those few people with the rare condition.

I'll allow it.
They called it Lost because that's what happened to the script.
Some of them honestly think the best parts of life are hedonism, gluttony, and laziness. They hate physical activity and love eating.Many of the ones who were fat since a young age have given up or think it is normal because that is how they were raised.You also have people who are simply delusional. This goes along with viewing it as normal; they do not view themselves as "that big" and they think their portion sizes and snacking are just fine. Exercising? Only gym obsessed people with no brains or personality do that so who cares?

You have time to fuck off on the internet, but not to explore rewarding hobbies?

No one is talking about only granting abortions in case of rape. This issue isn't even on our radar.This issue goes very deep. I'm heavily invested in issues such as this. If you want to have an in depth debate feel free to pm me. I think the issues, upside, and downside of feminism is too controversial a discussion for most people to engage in.I don't think the issue should be black and white. It should not be that I have to support feminism because conservatives in Texas want to eliminate abortion clinics. It would be really cool if we could have good discussions about such things but we can't really do that on reddit subs.I've tried and it just doesn't work.I will tell you this having had several such discussions before. We probably agree on almost everything. And there are a few things I'm sure we disagree on. No reason I can't respect you just because we don't agree 100% on everything.
A lot of 25 year olds are in a state of arrested development, especially if they are still clinging to school (hey, I don't want to get a job, I'll get a masters in social work!) as a way to borrow/spend other people's money and put off the transition to full time work and adulthood.I'm 30, I remember 25 pretty well, I remember 20 pretty well.

As horrible as it is for little dogs, I am glad I have never seen a planet with a large breed prone to joint damage. Breeds like Great Danes and Newfoundlands can have horrible problems with joints when raised in the ideal conditions - i.e. kept slight growing up so that they don't put additional stress on joints and kept from hard impact surfaces as much as possible. Overfeeding any animal is a death sentence but a large breed could be crippled by it before it is even fully grown.They have no idea about healthy weight and body fat coverage in animals - obviously including humans in that. I fucking hate the typical "ew, it is so underweight, you can see it's ribs" shite. You are *supposed* to be able to see or feel (if it is a fluffy thing or with some heavier - as in draught/draught-type - horse breeds) an animals ribs! It is stupid when they say it about people but really becomes dangerous when it comes to animals!Tl;dr : I hate fatties who cripple their pets because they have no self control or realistic idea of healthy weights.

So how does that work? Do they genuinely meet, and find each other the most attractive person out there, or is there some unconscious thought of, "Well, this is really the best *I* can get" ?

Hahaha I watched this movie like 3 times. Awesome film.
Watched it, and I wish that someone more capable/organized than I would start a gofundme or equivalent so that this lovely, intelligent woman can travel like she wishes to, she seems awesome and it's tearing me up that she has this dream that may never be realized. (this comment is sincere)
You wish. That's pixyteri, and she unfortunately has nudes. This is the thinnest she's ever been.
And she'd seem pretty small on the average American beach.
Shut up bitchredditor. You're the one talking shit on the internet. You'd probably run screaming if you had to call OP a shit person to his/her face.
Hate the way its udders spill out
Another account posted the photo. IG account is chasingthesun07
Not sure if this is 100% true for all military ham-lovers but I did notice this around my military buddies back when I used to work on-base. A lot of their wives were planets. Some Pluto, some Jupiter. The dudes, who were active duty and had to maintain certain BMI levels and what not were in decent shape. Doesn't make sense, right? So I decided to do some investigating. Asking how they met and shit. These astronomers proceed to pull out their phones and show me photos of them laying claim to their planetary discoveries pre-military. And, well...all the dudes were fat neckbeards prior to BMT. It was my ah-ha moment.
Or it'll make a brief, 7 minute video...
Wait so it isn't an f2m transsexual?
I wasn't even aware it didn't always refer to obese women.Also it is Big Bloated Whales. Much more accurate.
Hard water area and no filter.
As you should.
And ate it back plus an extra 15 because her triggered oppression was literally like a Holocaust victim. Thankfully she could garner support and sympathy from the heavily (hue hue) popular HAES tumblrina movement, which of course is based in science, and TOTALLY doctor approved.
Thanks for that mental picture. I think I'm never reading the comments again haha, damn it you shitlords make gross picture even worse :')
My thoughts this morning
The correct term is "skinny." The opposite of which is "fat."
Screwed up the title, sorry everyone my iphone wont let me edit it.
What usualy happens is they forget to count their "little" "unimportant" snacks , do an otherwise healthy diet for a week , then give up cause genetics.
Given how proud she is of her girth, I expected her to be fatter. Why, I'll bet her BMI is barely even 40! How dare she claim to represent a "real" body, she might even be able to walk to the fridge and back without collapsing from exhaustion!Fat shamer!
I went into this expecting to laugh, I finished it very impressed and a little more enlightened, so thank you. I might refer to this in the near future honestly, it's that good.
Some true thunder thighs... *shudders*
Even her feet are overweight.
Bride is trying to hide her lard behind the chair. It aint working.
In Norway everything (except alcohol) is marked with calories per 100g and calories per package/serving with the daily recommended percentages measured from a 2000 kcal per day baseline.People do however not know that there is roughly 7 kcalories in a kg of fat or that simply eating less than maintenance will make them lose weight.Culturally calorie counting and weighing of food was viewed something eating-disordered or freaks did 20 years ago - but times are changing and it has become more and more accepted and recommended as the population has become more and more overweight.
Freak on Facebook.
What can I say, I'm a trier. Trying to teach frequently overprivileged, 18-year-old upper-class white students any kind of abstract theory related to race/class/sex means I'm basically used to this, albeit that I normally can't put things quite so bluntly.
What picture are you looking at?
it was probably 12:45, but it was pretty late. I think she was about 8? It was also a weekday night.
Zelots make the best converts.
I have a huge pile of mixed greens with white or rice vinegar and salt for most of my lunches. It's, like, 20 calories total and I love it
FPH is amazing, because normal-sized people from all walks of life come here and are just the nicest people ever - so long as you're not fat. Seriously, coming from a hate sub, I expected to see more homophobia/gender hatred/racism, etc. Nope. All of the hatred is reserved for the fatties. So I'd just like to say thanks for being genuinely good people doing what's right for humanity. And for evolution as a whole.
The word has become more corrupted than the government.
Gymnastics coaches use a lot of spotting and drills to teach the skills. It might look good for a coach to demonstrate the skill but drills and spotting are more important.
And for pure comedy. Except this isn't funny. She's hurting the horse.
Sadly I'm currently on OKCupid and I never pay any attention to what they put down for weight. It is 90% of the time off by atleast 2 categories.
And the whole context of it..why did someone take this picture? To commemorate whatever party they were having? Or to capture they joke because these twats KNEW how disgusting they were and thought it was funny?
W......tf
&gt;1: please keep your idiotic whining inside your own subredditUm....s/he did.
Trust me-everyone at the pool cared about being forced to look at your excuse of a body. We am were all just raised with some home training and kept our mouths shut. You should try it!
either that or she will eat prisoners and gain weight, than blame it on society and genetics.
Anytime :3
"do something positive"So like scooter tipping?
That's called an asshole tax and as a business owner I can levy that on whomever I want
NanananananananaHey hey heyGoodbye
Me and my friends have recently started assuming that every car with a planet fitness sticker on it is just some fat girl trying to lie to the world. So far our assumptions have been right.
Adiposus noneckus has appeared in a shopping establishment.
NO. GOD. NO GOD PLEASE NO. NO. NO. NOOOOOOO.
I was the fat kid of the class all through out schoo, then in high school I started playing sports. Now I'm a shredded sick cunt. So fuck these idiots
But how else will they display their quirkiness???
She will actually gain weight. What a fool. My mom does this shit and she keeps trying to spread it to my son.No. Food is not a reward. We're not circus animals.
No you worded everything correctly! The other guy was just making a joke that 190 jocks are still smaller than this fat sack o shit.
That's why I hate when people refer to them, and when they refer to themselves, as *leftists*. Bitches, you know nothing about leftism, you've never even cracked *Das Kapital*, and all of your talk about being against "cultural appropriation" are fucked by the fact that 90% of your community likes to tag their shit with shit like "pizzasisterz4lyfe," you know, just like those *wacky blackies!* Everyone knows that Prince, R. Kelly, and maybe Usher are the only people allowed to use letters and numbers in place of words.Seriously just fuck these people so goddamn much.
Sooooo disgusting.
Oh yeah, the crabs pulling each other down the bucket when trying to escape. Gotcha :)
Man, I'm not even sure Sheiky baby could suplex him, make him humble.Fairly sure that is Haystacks Calhoun.
Well, no dinner for me tonight.
For the low low price of 0 dollars a month you can not see them and still not support a fatty
His tits are bigger than my fiance's tits... That's fucking disgusting
"Modeling"[MFW](URL
I don't know. I was just there for the show.
&gt;Humans should be evolving and becoming more.Unfortunately, there are those who think it's ok to become more; more fat, more lazy and more accepted even though they are a burden to society. But don't worry, we are at the other end of the spectrum teaching our youth that it's not ok to be obese.
She couldn't go the distance.
Actually, we don't. "Oh but they're not *that* fat" is what killed FatLogic. The sidebar doesn't say "Really fat" it says "BMI &gt; 24.9". This... thing definitely has BMI higher than that, so it's fat and posting it here is good. It gets all the semi-sympathisers out into the open so we can deal with their shit.
You know that's a good question. If she's under that age she has certainly mastered the frumpy look.
not morbidly obese because Tess is waaaay bigger than that :P
Rasputia alert.
I recently went on vacation and my hotel room didn't have a fridge. Most of the food was from the ball park, and quick snacks here and there because there wasn't a grocery store nearby. By the third day, my body felt like CRAP. I was craving fruits and vegetables so badly. I made it my mission to find a store and loaded up on real food. I cannot fathom how people eat shit food all day, every day. How do they even function?
*Doooes* your gut hang lowDoes it wobble to and froCan you tie it in a breadknotCan you tie it in some moldDoes your gutHangLow
i have to give her props for the idea, it's slutty as fuck
Damn. Who is that cute redhead on the right?
I'm guessing she has naturally curly hair no one ever taught her how to handle properly. Andplusalso the bleach. There are just a whole lot of fails going on here.
Really? Trees is chill as fuck. What asshat would even care? I was under the (perhaps ignorance) impressiomy that most redditers were propineapple.
I found this on the front page! We made it!!!
Gingers can be sexy. Fat can't.
That is a class X planet. Not FIT for human habitation.
Its not even the dressingless salads so much as remembering that a salad dressing is just supposed to be a dressing, not a component part of the meal, that's the problem.
kindly provide evidence I didn't just hit a home run then catch it. You can't prove a negative.
Fuck off hams. We don't want "good" or "bad" Fatties. We hate all of you. Losing weight? well if right now you're fat, fuck off. 100% don't "Accept it" as the pig above me is spewing from its food-hole.
Oh, and I love the fat bitches that try to get military discounts because "my husband is a marine." Even better when those fat cunts get pissed because they're denied a discount because the discount is for military personal, not people who are related to/know military personal. "My husband is fighting terrorists in Afganistan, and you won't even give me a 2 dollar discount on a movie ticket? You had better be happy we have people who protect cowards like you!" -And yes, I heard that pretty much verbatim.
Who the fuck drinks from a straw like that? It looks like her tongue is stuck in between her bottom lip and the straw, how do you drink from a straw with your tongue? This is making me irrationally angry.
The thing in orange, the Butter Behemoth, is so fucking fat she has started to absorb her scootypuff. Jesus
Bahahaha! Dis iz Gold ^
Appreciate it
I got my knee worked on at 30, but that was from a skiing accident.
Osmosis shaped.
Also : plays M: TG, still virgin, won't pass on genetic material.
Sometimes I feel bad for fat people. Then I see shit like this and my sympathy is crushed like a normal under a fatties weight. They just don't give a shit and are totally unwilling to listen. Fatso, if you're being given unsolicited weight loss advice from a doctor it's because you are HUGE and your size is impacting every aspect of your health. That sore throat? Your immune system could have fought it off if you weren't carrying an extra 100 pounds. High blood pressure? I don't need to actually take it to know it's too high and you need to lose weight to bring it down. (Even though what type of BS doctor's office doesn't take your BP before doing anything else? The imaginary kind, I suppose.)"diagnosisfat" indeed. That's my amateur diagnosis as well. You're fat.
wtf, the moment you are fatter than Santa, you should really think about your life.
Although i cannot see any part of my body besides my numerous chins, i am healthy
Thank God they give you a "switch to men" option just in case it was photos of all fatties..URL
It's a bloody doll. Young girls don't really care about the body shape of a doll or how much it looks like the 'average' woman. They care much more about how pretty it is or what comes with it. I know when I was younger I went for the doll that came with the coolest accessories and that sort of thing, most definitely NOT which one I thought most looked like the women in my life.
Hahaha I know, shocking right? But it's just been my experience the sex with guys on the smaller side has been way more enjoyable. Also, the guys with the smaller ones seem way more proficient in the ways of going down. But that may just be me that thinks so...
because liquid calories don't count!
Lmao wait, is this a before and after of a SINGLE WORKOUT? He's wearing the same outfit. The amount of weight that he lost could probably be sweat. I lose half that much running for an hour and I'm less than half his size. The degree of the need for instant gratification in hams is insane.
Please only keep your comments directed towards the chub.
What's wrong with superhero shirts, may I ask?
I used to believe in a line but then I saw someone that weighed over 350 pounds and finally understood that there are no limits to some people. Tess is proof that there is no line to how far they can sink or how far they'll go when it comes to publicly spewing shit. You're right that this pushes the limit of what one would normally consider believable, but I've seen that line crossed too many times in real life and on social media to dismiss the possibility.
Yeah this is going a bit too far.
Omg that sucks
thanks for this :D
lol!
Yeah she seems to be a coat-tailer. I'd be surprised if she had any sincere passion for social justice outside of her coterie of FAers.
Yeah well I'm sure your mother is disappointed in your five asses. Get out of here! Shoo! Shoo! And take all your asses with you.Banned
Mmmm yeah he [is](URL
Horrible, horrible tat. And in Curlz MT no less...
I am so incredibly jealous. If you get any more, can you send them my way? Just say, "hey this other guy wants to hear from you..."
I'm too greasy for that to work.
I love when they give tips on contouring. Makeup is a fun tool to amplify features, but you ain't fooling no one trying to put cheek bones on that dough boy face
I'm pretty sure that the word "gonna" will be taken over by a fold.
Agree with this... gotta make it mobile as well in order to get a large (NOT large) following LOL because us non fatties are not sitting in our house all day in front of the computer.. we are out there being active :)
If by nutrition you mean gear, then yes.
I'd rather see the hamily pay. Use some of their snack funds.
Actually saw the video on here. Immediately saw the post and had to comment. This is awesome.
That's udderly revolting!
A footlong sub is just under £6 i think, so it would be more expensive for 2 of those + drink + fries substitute
She's a useless sack of lard, who cares
or has like 5 kids.
You and me both. I was at the dumbbell area and got a strong whiff of pizza. It's almost nauseating enough to leave.
I wish this butter huffer would get banned.
If you know the difference between 'You're', 'Your' and 'Yore'... ur gonna get zulu'd.
It's a damn shame too, blue eyes with dark hair looks great on normal sized women...smh what a waste
Need evidence of requirement of 7k. PM tits^/s^^stillwelcome
please link your fave!I don't think I can watch so many obeests on one sitting and not puke.Lauren is only 19!!! and she gained 15stone (95kg) over 3 years. WTF. that's like, 33kg a year. fuck.
Wow I bet her back fat could crush a hand.
It gets worse. Crack heads don't need special ambulances and bariatric gurnies
I'm with you. There's no direct fat hate here so what's the purpose of this post?
Wow, you look stunning. Kudos to you!

I realize that but let's not pretend a muffin is anything more than mini cake
Thin privilege : run faster for longer and burn less calories as you lose weight : (
Imagine the heart.
We aren't here to help them. Their choice, their problem. I am here to shame them though. It's fun.Fuck off.
So many hugs and apple pieces
shes so fat in the last picture she can't even take a selfie like the other two pictures
FA would say it was shaming to show a fupa-beast in its natural habitat
Fat familys are the worst bro 10/10 i can't stand sitting in the room with my family anymore there breathing and eating makes me feel like a zoo keeper
Hans are lowering the bar. Thankfully, they are all going to die off soon enough.
This chick weighs like 20 lbs less than your wife at the same height...
You're right, I can't handle it. I don't have a license to handle livestock.
Shits good.
What this ham means by 'dark' is that it's not 'very bright'.
Yeah, but were creating [robot bees](URL
Such a shame! She was super cute in that girl next door way.
aw dang. Oh well I guess. I'm French so I know the hair despair.
I don't think it's smugness I think he's trying his hardest to not eat that lion before they snap the picture.
Hams will never learn that you catch more flies with honey than vinegar, which is strange considering their own affinity for sweets. They think the only way to get what you want is to throw a tantrum.
Okay, then a fatty who thinks she has a pretty face.
It always breaks my heart when I see those Progress pics.The world would be full of beautiful People If everyone fucking cared enough about their own body to not eat like a pig
Good, at least they didn't go bad. I've seen them sit sadly while landwhale after landwhale pass them by for more beetus-riddled options.
So insecure, wow
I wear everything at my hips though and it feels weird if pants are too close to my belly button
I've taken to parking where it's fairly vacant. I don't mind the nice extra walk, and my car is less likely to get banged/backed into/crushed.
Melissa's story was what the show strives to be and most that first season knew they had a once in a lifetime chance and took it, she was a wonderful person and a real inspiration. Penny was a puddle. She was a horrible person who didn't care what she was doing to those around her and it wasn't just sick but it was maddening. The world asks more directly her families world would be far better without the burden she has become.
&gt; But she looks like a womanThat doesn't make her a woman, as other pictures in this thread have shown.&gt; acts like a woman So do lots of gay guys. That doesn't make them women.&gt; and has a vagina That's not a vagina. It's a surgeon-created hole.&gt; so in my eyes she is a woman. Get your eyes checked.
BZZZZZZZZ : Wrong. Never been in recovery, you feeble minded simpleton. : )
If you're nice enough and there was any last minute cancellations/no shows, they'll move you! I fly a lot as well for work, sometimes they book the flight day of and I can't get into business or first. The worst ever ham was in July of 2013. I've never seen someone so huge in my life. I got stuck with the middle seat, one ham on each side. The ham in the window seat was at least 550-600, think [Homer in a moo moo](URLI was flying into a country that's very well known for men marrying fat women for a visa to the US/Canada. In the 20 minutes I was stuck next to her she was talking to the ham on the other side of me about her wedding. I dealt with it until seat belt sign was turned off, so I went to the flight attendant and explained the situation as nicely as possible. She understood completely after she did a quick walk by to peek. Luckily there was a no show up front and I was able to move. The funny thing is that when leaving the airport I saw her husband to be picking her up and he was smoking hot. I think it's hilarious she thinks he wants to marry her for anything but a visa.
It's insanity. "Ew, I bet she stiiiiiiinks!" Yes, probably, but because of her rolls, not a little body hair. People act like women have special magic body hair that reeks all the time, but men (99% of whom have never shaved pits in their lives) are fine? WTF?
r/theydidthemath will probably not appreciate it. And that's a shame. fyi, in the original Fight Club (the book) Tyler made one of his batches of soap from Marla's mother. Well, her liposuction fat that she had asked them to store in their freezer to re-use later for plastic surgery. You know how the movie was awesome? the book is just as awesome, only with more wtf.
That shit needs an NSFW tag
I prefer morbidly obese to superobese
This is the only way she can wash her ham feet
Hey... at least she's doing something active. Can't fault her there. Maybe it's one of her first steps to bettering herself
I always remember that word from Monty Python's [cheese shop sketch.](URL
Dafuq did I just watch? I tried to go earlier in the video for context and I only became more confused.
Oh ok,i get your point. Thanks for the info btw, I didn't know that But maybe he isn't from Kuwait though
I can't stand these kind of pseudo-dogooders. Get fucked!If everyone is beautiful then nobody is!You want everyone to be accepted? Does that include murderers, rapists and paedophiles? I thought not.The only people holding back mankind are you ignorant pricks that want to ignore the problems of the world (fatties) instead of addressing them.Your heads are the fucking clouds, you have no concept of reality if you's think any of this stupid shit you talk about is possible!
The sad part is that someone looked at that and got legitimately upset that it only went up to 8XL and not 9XL.
I work at a sex shop, and we sell a butterball sized blow up doll. I could only imagine the time it would take to actually fill it.
PC should be left to unchangeable aspects of who we are gender, orientation, height, nationality, ethnicity, and to a degree religion. PC is not for the controllable, changeable, and flexible parts of life.
Buy a belt that they make in your size. Are you slow?
So infuriating!
Fuck off white knight
The delusion is strong with this one.
I'm implying that people here who call out obese people who've eaten pizza for breakfast aren't against pizza for breakfast but instead obese people doing it.
Also he has sex with gilly on the ship to oldtown which would be pretty hard if he was very fat
Ew. I think the thing with the beard is here brother. They have the same nose.
I had no idea Carson Daly was even around anymore!
STAAAAHHHP!
My mom always refers to fat people as a "Two-tonne Tessie." Now I get it.
mfw fat girls who think they have an hourglass figure because their 150cm hips are bigger than their 100cm waist
I am with theo I hate jiggly Giants.
The hams have a ugly mouf... I mean mouth.
Voluntary exercise doesn't work. Coerced exercise doesn't work. And we all know that diets don't work. Hams have no option but to die fat.
I gained a fair amount of weight in 1st year, then lost it 2nd year because I couldn't afford both food and beer.
Should call it sausage casing instead of crop top

You must be short, 120 would mean no muscle mass for me.
Why not both?
What is suppose to be the difference in the picture? Like which part is smaller? I see this on another sub and I was too scared to ask this.
How can you tell the blogger's hair color?
Real women have fupas and cottage cheese legs.
This is so upsetting, I've been depressed for a year now I look like the one on the right body wise.
It's not sarcasm. I really want fartpeoplehate shut down. They make fun of people because of a perfectly natural biological function.
Nooooo! She was so damn cute.We SERIOUSLY need a fat education beyond "health class" program in schools.
this photo upset me and your words make me happy
Jesus. H. Christ.It's being treated by the observers as a sick disgusting animal. And later, when the landwhale sobers up, she's likely to think "they love me so much for who I am!"No you fat fucking slug. You're an animal to be observed and mocked.Zoo's treat frog exhibits better because at least they have self respect.
He looks, sounds,and probably smells like peanut butter, like his mouth is constantly full of it to the point where a normal person would gag on it.
On one hand, they don't care about your ideas of attractiveness. On the other hand, they're more attractive than you because of their boobs. It's a game of picking and choosing the qualities of 'attractiveness' that suit their delusional narrative.
"I wish I had bigger boobs" - 1995
It's definitely the pose that makes fatsos go and eat a burger just by looking at her. I think while they were saying "eat more" they were stuffing their faces.
Burger music starts playing
YouTube make you watch an ad before the actual video loads nowadays.
Clearly without a doubt he is white dude
I agree that it sounds inflammatory. It's an 8-yr-old, it's entirely possible that she saw what was for dinner and didn't like it and threw a tantrum over having to eat it. Then mom said "okay, dinner will be in the fridge for you when you're hungry enough to eat it".
I'm in class, but I can link you to the article later. Buuut it pretty much is all doggy style
First off, frame size does exist. There are variations in skeletal structure. That being said, how much stock do you put in sources that have large-framed people at acceptable weights with BMIs above 25? (Personally, I think 25 is a solid upper limit.)
You forget how they contaminate the air with their foul odor before they even begin to sweat.
I don't even know what I just looked at.
Not sure how that refutes his point
yes, everyone hates you
I'm on board. $500 from me. No, really. I mean it. I'll pay $500 to her chairity of choice to see that.
Does she not even realize that people laugh at the story because of the guy being so fat that he killed an animal by falling on it and not because the fact that the dog died?
Reppin' that Bay Area!
Please tell me they were doing one of those photos where they're recreating a pic from years ago when the kids were little, so there's actually a somewhat explainable reason for her to be on his lap? Please?
wow, a lot of the tiny island nations are fat. wonder if that just make it easier to float instead of swimming?
Holy shit at first I thought that was a child's cart... That's disgusting.
No kidding and at least he had actual TALENT in something. Standing around with you mouth open like a fish calling yourself a model isn't a talent.
I would rather be celibate forever than settle for a dude with 'dad bod'. It grosses me out just thinking about letting some flabmonster touch me, ugh.
I hear ya.
Yeah! Down with the patriarchy!You're in the wrong sub though. Rule 3 warning.
I really hate this stupid degenerate website, but I like how much butthurt they manage to cause with the fats.
Looks like they got marooned on the beach after making clothes out of the sails.
If only that would work. I doubt it would, unfortunately. Unless a child is hugely obese, I don't think child services would take them away. I don't know where OP is, but I can think of some states where giving your child chocolate cake would just pass as showing them love and affection, sadly...
Her second chin made an appearance in the second photo.
"I'm such an activist! Tee Hee!" They think the more hash tags they have, the more rebellious and strong they are! Because that's what REEL activists do! Add hash tags!
might be, yeah.and it is. it's very fucked up. but so is getting someone to feed you to death. S:
Her face looks almost skinny. Heck yes it's photoshopped.
Well no, this ailment is not specificaly related to obesity. It rather comes from drinking and smoking. or a malfunction of the kidney's where they produce too much protein or too little salt. Also side effects of certain medicine can be the cause.
Wow, never saw that and my mind was instantly filled with vivid visualizations of hamplanets using this thing. I would like to barf in my mouth now
I hope you reported it for nudity/beastiality.
Well, allowed or not, I took it. I don't mind surveys as long as they aren't unbearably long. Good luck with your study.
Seriously! Dear FPH, it's the second time this week I am at a loss for words. It seems to happen only in this sub.
It triggers me. But seriously my condolences to OP.
No! Play it the other way, Sam!
reported ^^^/s
I read your title, looked at the blood in the thumbnail image, and assumed this person had gotten drunk off a few tots or killed and eaten an infant human.TIL what Tater Tots are.
You don't respond to any concrete points, which is no surprise coming from a professional denialist.conclusion: your brain is as lazy as your fat body.
;D ... All the better to keep you awake at night with ~~
Fatfuck make-up: cheeto dust mascara.
Monday this happens
So.. What do they feel is accomplished by posting this?Do you think we view you any physically different because you went to the gym? Nope, still fat.Do you expect us to commend you for at least trying to get in shape? Nope, you should have been doing that anyway.Do you expect encouragement and moral support? Nope, the results from your last physical and a glance into the mirror should have done that.
6'2" here as well. But as a former Marine I gained enough muscle to put me at the 210 lbs mark without being a ham. A little discipline goes a long way.
We could make so much money praying on the lust, ego and appetite of fat fucks. Make some sort of social media website with a focus on "working out" and *oh check out this cool recipe for heavenly bacon brownies with ice cream!* It's a rough business model at the minute.
Charge every night, all night, and at every opportunity....sounds about right. I'd wanna die if I were those mart carts too.
Pressure ulcers from being in one position for long periods of time. You see this with the elderly.
yes thin people are ridiculed and told to "eat a sandwich." Somehow that is different though right? Thin privilege.
Luckily I was on a dry campus and underage so I couldn't drink. Alcohol makes me feel nauseated though so I rarely drink now that I'm of age. But hell i was also encephalopathic during that time so I probably forgot to eat. (Secondary problems after liver transplant. No fatty liver disease or anything, super tumor fucked it up when I was 16 and I was finally transplanted at 19) so even though I was only in college one semester before having to drop out to have further surgeries, I didn't gain a lb. No reason to, I ate reasonable portions when I was hungry.
ugtacular
I had pizza for lunch today. But it had spinach on it which has negative calories, so I probably shouldn't even count it. /s
And a cunt. She thinks people that earn below 50 grand a year should not be allowed to smoke or drink. I hope I get the chance to kill that fat entitled cunt face with a flame thrower. Btw she was born in to the money/mining business she's never actually worked a day in her useless God dam life!!!!ARHFHGHRHRHRHGHFHFHRGRGRH FUCK U GINA RINEHEAAAARRRTTTTTT YA CUNT!!!!!
I sure don't LOOK fat, though O.o Maybe that's just my ample height. I'll certainly see myself out
Wow, that is fucking disgusting. Sorry you have to deal with people like that. And I feel terrible for their kids because their childhood will consist of nothing but fatness and filth. I can't imagine how that's going to affect them in the long run.
Only way? shitfuck so you've never seen anything blow up on facebook, twitter, kickstarter. SOCIAL media? People can blow their own shit up now without news blowing it up for them.I don't get what you don't get, I'm concerned businesses will start trying to get business or money by picking a side in social controversy. Also, what's with that shit about autistim?
It is in this month's comic. There's also a shirtlord Milli-Tant.I threw mine away after reading it on the train, forgetting I was going to scan &amp; karma them :)
I don't see it either! OP IS A FAGGO - oh wait. He is. But really, I am wondering what OP means here.
It literally is the fattest city in America.
So you're looking for a long term relationship in your bisexuality? I thought not...move on.
With a name like /r/fatpeoplehate what do people expect?
Like a shitlord where's Waldo lol
oh yes that explains ha
There's nothing wrong with being elitist. Everyone here is one of those, only on the topic of fatness and bodyshape.Do you know the sorts of families she's referring to? Of course she'd prefer her kids to hang around with children who aren't destined to become lower class jailbirds.
there still will be some tubs of lard trying to grease their way into those seats.
You heard him people. Upvote upvote upvote all the good posts so our stuff can hit the front page. Good job shitlords!
I do like ranch, but only a little bit of it. I can make about two teaspoons of it dress an entire salad, I put it on top of my salad (I get one of those huge clamshell takeout containers, and I fill it up) and shake it to coat everything lightly. If Italian was an option in our dining hall I would choose it or a vinaigrette over ranch, though.
Arrgh, this song plays all the time at my gym classes and it makes me rage so hard. Other members and the trainers always ask why I rage at the song because they looooove it" but really its a bit hard to yell out "because shes a big fat ugly bitch saying to love your body but only if your a tub o' lard" while doing a wall sit in a room that might have fatties trying to get non fat. Worst thing the skinnies like the song too? Wtf yo..
I hope she doesn't reproduce. She will probably make her poor children morbildy obese as well.
She's a piece of art, that one. This thing is a burn pit.
HOLY FUCK. That thing looks like its going to keel over and die. O.o
I know, I was referencing the name of the thread it was posted and subsequently, the name of the meme he unwillingly formed.
I know everything on 4chan is 300% true, but every rape/sexual assault story involves a fat chick. Even if it's not true, it shows what 99% of men think of fatties.
I only said the story is fucked up. They are both pieces of shit.
Trying to clean bulk I can stuff my face all day and struggle to hit 3000calories on 'rabbit food'. It blows my mind that these fat fucks can just keep eating pure shit in the amounts that they do. Delusional fatties.
Do you think they ever have dreams where they are real people again and then wake up, realize that they are now filthy disgusting pigs, and scream?Wake up piggies.
Don't ship me any, I hate competition!
Is... is there a /r/neckbeardhate ?

What causes one to build up versus the other?
Because 35%+ of the us population is obese and I can't get away from it. Have to vent somewhere.
Looks like a flesh colored stay puff marshmallow man.
Oops sorry. Did I fix it?
You know what tastes even better than Pepperoncini potato chips?Fucking actual pepperoncini peppers.
I wouldn't doubt that there is someone fucked up enough to find her attractive. I mean if you are a rapist you are already messed up so it's not a huge leap.

I've thought about that too. I think that's the route I'll end up going. I actually am vegan because I have a hard time processing dairy from cows, and when I was younger all I would drink was goat milk.
You warned us. Why, oh why didn't I listen? xpost this to /r/rage
And what if I told you that Super Size Me was fake? In all these years, not one study has replicated his results, and to this day Mr Spurlock does not answer questions regarding his method.
Right?
What's the deal with her, is that a feeding fetish or something? What she cooks is absolutely disgusting, esp. all the disgusting carbs. And she adds piles of _sugar_ in everything, it's like she's not just trying to get even fatter but to wreck her liver as fast as possible as well.
Also there is a very thinly veiled double-meaning with the main character's nicknames and eating habits. Ana and Mia.
Yes it is sad to see a fit person get fat, but I love watching that train wreck unfold.
Hey now, Jabba was born that way thank you. These things become that way.
Thin privilege is only needing three models to make a throne instead of four.

Eating disorders aren't sexy? Uhhm, I'm pretty sure that binge eating is an eating disorder.
Hardly body shaming. More of a compliment really. Plus his wife took the photo. Oh well, I'm going to go listen to some of his music now
Bullshit
The irony is fat people telling other fat people it's ok to be fat. Yet when they are asked what their ideal mate is it is never a fat person. They always want a ripped guy or slim chick. The double standard annoys me to no end.
That's what I came to ask....it appears this....*thing*...is wearing Spanx on stage. Just the Spanx.O_oNo shame.
I noticed that. He's either finishing one plate &amp; starting another, or just leaving the plates from previous meals laying around. Either way, gross. What a pig, I can't imagine what that house must smell like.
Masturbating is one of my hobbies - though I don't typically use sex toys. I like trying new stuff, different positions, anything to change stuff up. Pillows, the shower, faucets, and even just thinking myself there (it's possible but takes a *looooong* time.I'll admit I've never thought about it before, but a hidden clit? My clit is actually inside my labia, and I basically have no inner labia either. But, I must say I've never had a problem getting to my clit.This is odd. They get mad at any implication that sex is difficult for them in terms of mechanics and positioning, but they can't even masturbate properly, much less easily? They can't rub their genitals with the aid of a toy without great difficulty. That's simply the height of stupid. You'd think that would be a wake-up call of sorts - not being able to masturbate. If I were them, I'd lose weight if only for that reason alone - that masturbating is great and I like to do it 2-3 times per day. They'd rather eat to an uncomfortable level than masturbate. I've lost hope for the world.
White rice also.

Bad ass title, OP!
Makes it a bitch to play.

Guess the gender?
MOOOOOO!! MOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
Dig it. Thanks. I meant angle as in the motivation, drive, or purpose.
Seriously if you're fat you're fat. You may "carry it well" but you still look wider than a healthy person and it's still gross.
No. Because we're perfectly happy mocking fat pastry rapists in our non-triggering safe space. We don't pursue an individual ham into the pasture, as it were, and keep it strictly online.Butter golems, however, have plenty of time on their hands to stalk people in the real world. Most of them have conned the government into giving them disability, so they have nothing better to do than stalk internet people who hurt their feelings by pointing out the reality of their wasteful, unhealthy lifestyle.

What a sack of shit. 4000 calories a day is fucking shameful. How does he pay for that? I can't bring myself to look into his stats because his face pisses me off. I'm assuming he doesn't have a 'job' outside of youtube."But he's trying!"NO, he's milking sympathy for eating one less ringding a day out of dozens.OP drank the koolaid if they think this person is anything but a gluttonous lardcollector.
Unfortunately it's not that simple. Fatties still looked at my profile even though I made it clear I wanted comparable attractiveness. Never knew how a hot girl felt until I was oggled at by disgusting pigbeast women.
I agree
Key difference is where you admit YOU were what needed to change. Not the rest of society.
Is it possible to take a picture of her and send it to your boss for evidence?
Suicide girls is for nasty trash.
That's not what normal actually means, though.
When you're trying to confuse the enemy as to wether or not you're coming or going.

Thanks. People are often shocked when they find out I lived the first 10 years of my life in a war zone because I'm so well adjusted, but that's because I never let myself stay a victim. And as someone who had severe ptsd for years, I hate when they use the word triggers. A trigger is me having a panic attack &amp; feel like I'm dying cuz that car backfiring sounded like a grenade, not you feeling shitty cuz someone reminded you how gross you are.
"Flat stomachs are not attractive anymore."'"6-pack abs you can grate cheese on are not attractive anymore."
I also love going straight to the bottom of the comment section and reading all the butthurt fatties. The best thing about when a post gets to /all!
Where are all the 50 yo "I am so cute and happy" healthy fat women?!?!?!?!? I would say it is age discrimination, but truth is they do not exist. They are all riding around on beetus scooters, missing legs, hoarder hermits living with 20 cats etc.These young women are seriously deluded, to the point of mental illness.Life will sort it out for them, but at a high cost to the rest of us as well.
How do her ankles not snap?
Is that a bruise or a nipple? Lmao
Self-taught. Mom cooked but never liked it so dinner was usually frozen chicken strips.
Yeah her tattoos look so awful they had to photoshop them out I guess
From the MDE newletter:&gt; ...&gt; Other misc. news:The videos have gone missing from YouTube because supposedly we have some Hollywood ppl. looking at our shit and we don't want them looking at a bunch of iPhone videos. They're still up on mde.tv and they'll be un-unlisted in a few weeks.&gt;Still working our asses off in case you didn't know. It's tough because currently all the projects we have underway are bigger things that we can't really share until they're done, so for the next good lil' while all we're good for is a hilarious tweet here or there.&gt;I'm (Sam) gonna be hitting stand-up hard soon, like every other day, so I'll be uploading that shit at some point.&gt;Nick and Charles are working on some web video for adult swim and together we're launching an entertainment/financial/tech news site called China Gold Daily... that's not too too far off in the future so stay tuned for that.&gt; PEACE

What are LEO tacks?
I would put a bullet in that hams head. Rape is already fucked up as is, but that story nearly made me puke.
Maybe OP is a tiny shitlady.
&gt; Would then order another 800-1000 calories from the in store diner for lunch, and start bitching about an hour later about how she didn't feel good.God fat people annoy the shit out of me with that. Ohh you got Lo Mein in ll those sauces from the local chinese joint instead of the fried rice. Yea great health choice it'll go great with your slab of Sysco Bourbon Chicken and General Tso chicken in being healthy!
I thought alot of people know her unfortunately this obeast is really popular on social media has like millions of followers on Fb,twitter, Vine and has a youtube channel.
This is so true, and as i have mentioned so many times before, food addiction and drug addiction are exactly the same. Unfortunately I put my SO through hell with me, as I went from not addicted, addicted, and now recovering. Its one of the hardest parts of the entire thing and also the most rewarding. He had every right to leave me and I know that. Its one of the things that keep me sober. He doesnt deserve it. Its the same as being fat. Nobody deserves having their partner go from normal to incredibly sick in a short amount of time. All of a sudden you are leaving work or quitting your job to take care of this person, all for them to tell you you aren't doing enough, simultaneously telling them to leave you alone about your choices...
They call him The somewhat disappointing Bulk.
Fucking linebacker-ass looking bitch
I'm not really in a position to judge people. My girlfriend is a lawyer, but she deals mostly with Family law or personal injury.I have a lot of respect for the ACLU. Despite the types of humor I enjoy, I'm a pretty big supporter of rights, and I think it's an extremely honorable route to go. If you do make it, good on you. It's actually a chance to make the world a better place.

Because make up is there to enhance natural lines along the face...which is hard to do when your face is so round it has no lines.
Rock ON!!! :D
About a week ago someone downvoted all my shit. I don't think it's happened since then. I just don't care enough I guess.
I don't mind group classes because they make me like cardio more - I'd rather do a step/circuit class than run on the treadmill - but my gym is nice enough to put them in a closed room on the "cardio" side. I keep reading about these gyms that do their classes right out on the floor and that just sounds like the dumbest shit ever.
No, but you're 100% fatty knees
Just as long as we don't directly link. Don't want to give the admins any reason to get rid of us.
&gt;the point of that fallacy is there is no definition of a true ScotsmanUm, sorry no. There *IS* a definition of a true Scotsman. Someone from Scotland. The fallacy points out the error in saying that "even though that person is from Scotland, they aren't 'true' scotsmen because of how they eat their porridge."So this is a NTS fallacy, because it's doing the same thing. A feminist = someone who advocates feminist theory. These people are advocating feminist theory, yet other feminists say they're not "true" feminists. But they are. QED rite there.
Working on being more active!

My knees groan in agony as I waddle to the Fat Cave to don my XXXXXXXL spandex bodysuit. After ten minutes of valiant struggle, I breathlessly admire myself in the mirror, and take a few selfies to post on Tumblr for later. I feel snug like a sausage in its casing...mmm, sausage--wait, back to the matter at hand.The distress call is coming through on HAM radio, a shitlord oppressing a big, beautiful woman over her thyroid condition. This shall not stand, and neither shall I, as I'm running out of breath. To the Fatmobile!
SA
Those pants look 10 sizes too small for her.
Yeah [im so big and bulky](URLEdit : love my shit-family : face_blowing_a_kiss:
She has like 5 oranges in a container, and she's going to eat the whole thing. Fat people are dumb, it sucks these people get to keep their kids, they don't have a fucking chance in hell.
As a wise man once said "I would never fuck her. I would rather lick my own balls than fuck that bitch. I would not fuck her with a koala's dick."From Robin Williams Live on Broadway standup. I think of this part (talking about why pandas aren't reproducing) every time there's a fatty who can't get laid.
There is a guy in this picture?
&gt; I watch what I eat but still I gain , I diet and exercise just to stay where I amYes ~~ma'am~~ ma'golem, of course you watch what you eat. Unless you're blind. Try watching only 30% of the food going down your butterchannel might help more though.
Ever notice how fatties try to make you feel guilty by inevitably bringing up a condishun? A condishun that, with 99% probability they're probably making up? A way to deflect responsibility? Newsflash fatties: even if you did have that condition, which you probably fucking don't, *eat less*. Boom.
I suspect it could be connected to why she gained weight in the first place. The sign implies childhood sexual abuse to me. I used to have the mentality where I used food to cope with trauma too... Then I came to my fucking senses and started working out instead. The point where someone uses a traumatic experience as an excuse to allow them to self destruct is the point where the problem ceases to be anyone else's fault.
All of the hate posts on here are just embarrassing levels of projection. You can really envision these hams saying these exact messages to themselves in a mirror.
he doesnt look like that anymore lol
The only chips I eat are ice chips.
&gt;Want a little redpill? No, please.
This is a clusterfuck of epic proportions. I honestly can't begin to describe how horrible this is. Literally, if a bunch of pixels decided to get together and make a shitty design, it wouldn't be as bad as this fuckheap.
Being the opposite of what they are. Unless, of course, you're gross and fat like them, then maybe they're not lying.
Literally
I hope these people don't have pets.... If they sit on them it would be instakill.
We're fucking too.
Naturally! As you make the final descent/ascent of the last stair, make sure to throw just a hint of bounce in your stride, to emphasize gravity's gentle grasp on your mass.Then, turning your body slightly by starting at your shoulders, give a flippant glance behind you, all while craning your neck to show that yes indeed, you actually HAVE a neck. Repeat as necessary.
Porkachu, I don't choose you
how can you get to be soooo fat that your fingers start collecting fat
No one's pointed out what "pants" mean in the UK.( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
That fucking sow would deserve to get punched in the face repeatedly. 10 days without pay, what a joke. And they let her keep working with children.Isn't it still quite dangerous to handle kids like that? Aside from any possible kinds of psychological trauma.The parents should sue her and the kindergarten. Hurt them where it really hurts them - in their wallets.
it is pretty mean to do such a horrible ripoff
She said yes to diabeetus
Oh don't worry, I think he's the only one fooled. Dude has like a solid 3 inch layer of fat EVERYWHERE, and a giant beer gut to boot. Gross.
My ex's massive sister gave me a pair of zip boots once. I think that they were so stretched apart that the zipper couldn't stay shut anymore because I could never get the stupid things to zip up and stay and I definitely wasn't too fat for them. Blech.
Serious question, doesn't a calorie deficit diet help you lose weight? That's what I'm doing cause I'm 25.1 bmi and j wanna get to 23 :(
I was gonna say 8th grader
I don't think there is one. A few years ago I came across something called "Fitnesssingles" or something like that, but that site was basically dead.
ugh. feeder fetish.URL
in this picture the middle one is the alpha girl. 2fat planets on the left, two normal looking on the right. idk if this is subjective bias or watching through a specific subjective scope, but shes also the most appealing of the pack.edit : my brain recovered, the brunette right of her has a cuter face. still the midle is the alpha : =)
But...but the chest on that can't be females. God if so that's rank,
Maybe his BMI is borderline, but those are definitely not abs.
Thoroughly unpleasant, but, as befits his position, also thoroughly unaware. Those two things seem to go hand in hand.
I thought the same thing. Women's clothing sizes don't make sense. The smallest pants size is a zero I think. I'm glad that men's clothing sizes make perfect sense.
Sexual materialist? I'm sorry I find a good physical form sexually appealing?
might even save some in a bucket for later.

See this is what my ex did for me when I was creeping up towards a BMI of 24-25. The fact is occasionally most people have weight fluctuations. The difference between humans and butter beasts is that it's acknowledged and patterns are changed.
I looove TED talks, link please

When you think about it a fupa is a home-grown chastity belt. An effective one.
I got anxious the other night when I went out with a group to eat. We ended up going to a fried fish place that literally only served fried junk except for a single grilled fillet (that still came with fries, hush puppies, and coleslaw-bleh). There were no replacements-no veggies or salads (you bet 90% of the people in there were hippo size or approaching it). I avoid fried food, red meats, and poultry, so I get worried about coming of as high maintenance by trying to see about going elsewhere. :(
Hmm. Very interesting point. I honestly don't know much about the psychology behind PTSD, but I know it is correlated with extremely traumatic and negative experiences the person has had. I think that the fatties, as they so often do, pick and choose things from studies and construe these symptoms to fit their "conditions". I think this is applicable to PTSD which says that symptoms include "increased anxiety and emotional arousal". They take snippets of the whole picture and say that it is applicable to them.Thoughts?
You can see my collarbones all the way to my shoulders. I've always thought it looked *disgusting* on me. Bless you, TattooedWife ;_;
You know you're fucked when you've resorted to buying *spells* for weight loss.
I love that she found a friend fatter than her to be the maid of honor. It's not gonna make her look any smaller.
She has a really angry, "don't steal my pie" look in her eyes. I'm scared.
OK, I'm all about hating fat people, but at least be truthful about their age in your posts. This woman cannot be 20, she looks older than my mother.
I don't see why there cannot be some sort of punishment system in healthcare.

Hypocrite! Lol. "Fat fuck" is being used in a derogatory way. Now, as you ponder your dumbass-ness for contradicting yourself, I will be reporting you to the "Fucking Stupid Police".
Being fat is a career choice now.
I thought the thumbnail showed the earth from orbit.
Besides why should you care about people who clearly don't care about themselves?
The fact that you are a shitty enough person to try and spread your stupid bullshit in a thread about a persons passing is disgusting. I am willing to wager that you are a fat shit.
Where do you come from?In my state, the homeless are degenerate and a drain on tourism, society, and general morale. They prowl the metro area and make it seem so dirty and ghetto, it's terrible.Can't take public transport, either, without being asked for/offered all sorts of things by people who you suspect may go crazy on you at any moment.

Former fat fuck here. Now normal, that's exactly how it happens. These fat fucks just tune out reality, stop getting on the scale, and eat to ignore their problems.Then the next thing you know the largest pants sold in stores are the pants you are overflowing out of.

I'm pretty sure with that bod, she can lift more than 60........penises. ಠ__ಠ
For me, that border is crossed when you can look at a fatass and not distinguish a single bone in its body. Once the fat has fully engulfed their visible skeletal structure, they've crossed over from fatass to O-beast.
Body Positive? The only thing positive about her body is her beetus status.
The doughnut has to be flattened a bit so they are they thickness of a normal bun. Normally it is done before they are pit on the burger so you don't destroy it right out of the gate. But for presentation purposes I guess you can leave them unflattened. They are heated before hand or fresh so they are hot and sticky... Lots of cardio to reverse any gains must be done, or skip lunch before eating and all is well

I absolutely did not mean any offense, I hope that's clear. I just had a bad run in with an Asian piggy on new years two years ago. She was from my high school and had a crush and I just got over a bad break up. I couldn't get it up at all cause I was disgusted by the fat (and snoring later, but that's for another day.) I do see the thing with it going to the face. I guess my shitlord hope is in Asia to keep the sea of fat at bay and I am really disappointed when I see something like this.
The thins that are enabling the fats are just as bad.And the one in the back is wearing a fucking mask.
If anything, a good parent will be more active when they have kids. All it takes is playing outside with them (bike rides, trampolines, swimming, tag, hide and seek.) I'm not a mom but I do babysit 3 boys and it can be a great workout if you want to make it one. Also the kids enjoy it so it's a win win.
This really can't be real, I can't believe such a delusional person exists.
Yes, think of those small boutiques for the Omas. Used to be expensive and small sizes. But if you have a look around, since the past 15 years or so, there's a growing number of women getting huge and are in their late 30s/early 40s. I think the men still get the classic *Wampe* a little later.
She has a 64 ounce slushie next to her as she's saying that.

Stick with it then. Stay on top of your diet and maybe toss in a couple extra exercises on each day. Although that's just my preference, my workouts are fairly intense. Also always remember that friends come and go, but 200lbs is always 200lbs, the iron never lies. Good luck!
Rule of thumb: if you see a portrait of a woman and the nostril is not visible at all, then she is fat.

Well I'm American but have been living in Dubai for about four years. For Emiratis, I think it very much has to do with gender roles; where the woman is somewhat confined to the home and generally does little work requiring physical effort. If you add in the higher socioeconomic status, even the physical labour required for child care in the home is subsidized by maids. This is magnified in Saudi Arabia for sure. Additionally, while the traditional abaya is not required, many Emirati women still choose to wear it. This may sound shallow, but the abaya does cover up everything and doesn't form fit. I think this equals less pressure to be thin. Even in Iraq (I've only been to Basra, don't know about Baghdad), those that do have a little money tend to be on the bigger side.

I think she was dieting when she got pregnant. She said she had been trying for a while and decided to focus on getting healthy first and then got pregnant. I think she must have achieved some health and her body went for it.

The girl who made the comment about boobs, butt, and toned stomach looked 250 lbs. Most of the rest were whales too.
Psychologists makes a lot of sense. And scientists? Woot.
Convex curvy vs concave curvy
Good to hear!
No, they'd have disgusting-looking skin. Not the nice glow that these ones have.
Good god. I was eating some powdered donuts earlier and read the package and it grossed me out. This is much, much worse.
yeah this yak lasted 4 minutes lol
[Then this happens](URL
That's a girl. I can tell by the delicate way she holds her cigarette and dumbly gapes at her phone. What do you think she's reading?
I knew that much:PIt's actually worse for a fatty to starve themselves. Because the body attacks both muscle and fat for energy reserves. Due to the fact that more muscle mass means faster metabolism, when fatties lose muscle their metabolism slows. This is why crash diets often work but then the weight all comes back on and often more weight.
Implying it would only eat 1 cookie
How the hell it is possible to make such an illusion?
Is that burger making direct contact with the ground? At least put a square of toilet tissue. 99% chance he/she did not wash their hands after taking a dumb.
Oh lawd
The British part of Cali, obvs. Los Angeles!
She sounds gross as hellBut then some people can't see past tits and that's it
Think privilege is my boyfriend not worrying my side of the car when he parks cos he know I will be able to get out lol.
I would feel bad about eating 30 wings. After all, that would mean that 15 chickens would have to give up their lives. j/k
I don't look like one either (female figure competitor) but anyone that puts effort into their body deserves respect IMO. And they look great.
ADA requires accessibility to a place, but does not require scooters.
I will take you at your word on that one, I wouldn't dare underestimate your judgement.
The really sad this is by tumblr standards, shes anorexic.
Lol. She was absorbing them punches like Butterbean until she got one in the face lol.
Do you like prunes/ raisins? I have a good dehydrator and we use that for jerky and prunes. It's great having control over how much sugar/salt/msg goes into the process and I'll eat like 10 prunes in a row :)
Wonder why you never find any fat surgeons?
They can't do e-sports either since their fingers are too fat&amp;greasy to hit the right things.
Probably thinks apples are full of poison unless it's in a pie a la mode.
I think thats a standard set up but it only looks like string ham in fat peopleURL
Got to get with time. Now they ride fat-carts.
Just take a picture of their license plate before you leave. If they do damage, file a hit and run report with the police.

'Eats entire family" I actually laughed out loud
As if any article of clothing can hide what her body expresses: "I'm lazy, selfish, greedy and dumb".
/r/TalesOfFatHate time?
I still think it's funny. :)
Love the username, by the way.
These are the same fat fucks that come into my work wearing expensive leather boots/heels acting better than me because they're buying vegan fucking ice cream.
A 5k in 90 minutes?! Shit, I could watch a two hour movie first and still finish before that gelatinous blob.
Congrats on your recovery :) and very well said.
Gaining and then losing weight doesn't prove that all people can lose 15 pounds with the same regiment. I eat half a pizza literally 3 times a week or more and I can't break 150 lbs. It's such a narrow and ignorant view to claim that the only differences between people are laziness. I'm lazy as fuck but I'm not fat and never have been. I'm pretty sure I'm incapable of being fat based on my biology and my automatic psychological responses to food, which i have no control over. Who am I kidding, this sub doesn't care.&gt;A peasant thinks that it has hailed on his field by chance; but the philosopher knows that there is no chance, and that it was impossible, in the constitution of this world, for it not to hail on that day in that place.&gt;There are persons who, frightened by this truth, admit half of it, as debtors who offer half to their creditors, and ask respite for the rest. " There are," they say, " some events which are necessary, and others which are not." It would be very comic that one part of the world was arranged, and that the other were not; that a part of what happens had to happen, and that another part of what happens did not have to happen. If one looks closely at it, one sees that the doctrine contrary to that of destiny is absurd; but there are many people destined to reason badly, others not to reason at all, others to persecute those who reason.Peasants.
You are doing it again, aren't you? You are trying to imply that I have denied starvation and typhus epidemics in general, while I made it clear that typhus epidemics were a fact of reality in Auschwitz as in most other camps. You then proceed to call this a "joke", but you are just talking about your own strawmen.And yes, words such as "faggot" do reflect badly upon the rest of us. That was not the only primitive form of attack you used either.Oh, and you have responded to many of my posts. Including this last one, obviously. So it seems it is you that need a reality check. Or maybe you are just here for the simple-minded rhetorics.
I certainly get your point, my estimation was taking angles into consideration, but I agree it is definitely a fine line and with a tagged photo I may be proved wrong
They are ridiculously stupid and pathetically lazy. Yeah, they'll totally be the survivors.
As an avid watcher of ANTM I definitely know smizing! Haha thanks though :) I have a weird thing about my teeth that no one in my life understands.
Hahaha indeed. It's feet are so fucking wide they're probably even a few sizes up and still don't fit quite properly :p
Oh you (σˋ▽ˊ)σ
Seriously out of everything this part pissed me off the most. I can understand mixing up things like "of" and "have" as in "I could of done that", or they're/there/their, but how can you use a verb in place of a noun in your sentence and think that's okay?
I laughed WAAAAY too hard at that, *dries eyes, clicks save button* Thank you!
Also it doesn't want to go into starvation mode which will add another 100 lbs overnight

I saw this on MUA and thought I was on this sub... Was going to comment something rude on it there.
*"But Daddy I wanted to see the Elephants* **and** *the Whales! :("*
I LOL'd so hard at the "explanation" as what weight was to the hippo. XD
They got like $100k+ for setting up a non-profit for black girls and supposedly someone taught the black girls how to "code". Obviously IrbyTremor was behind it. And now I think she is also behind Alexis coming back to Reddit. Especially after that "leaked" note.
That fat belly peek-a-boo is a testimony of her professionalism.
Still got a boner after looking at that?
Actually: 1. We receive posts that say specifically this.2. I personally receive multiple PM's a month that say specifically this.3. As a personal trainer, some clients request specifically this.Don't feign moral high ground when you're too intellectually dishonest to actually learn the facts before forming your opinion. GTFO.
Not a cashier but I get this nearly every time I go to a store. Saw a huge ham nearly rip the arm off of her scrawny boyfriend because he looked at me. I was walking right toward them so he could hardly avoid seeing me. Jesus, like you said, WOMAN, I DO NOT LUST AFTER YOUR MAN.
Fits somewhere into the mental illness category
I want those shoes shitlord.
Oh can we have a fat free zone sign for out banner? mods?
Sorry, it definitely does not read that way. There are others right in this thread who did not know what a century was.
this is the same woman who posted that she wants BIG BLACK DICK after watching the riotsURLI guess her brother's dick game is weak
What's the point of going to Disney World if you can't *do* anything there?
She ate the team
As in to drink. Healthy beverage choice.
What kind of juice have you tried? Apple juice can act as a laxative and I'm sure others do too.
I think we do need a zombie apocalypse to purge our genetic pool of all the fatties. The fat and stupid will die first, leaving only the fit and capable. Someone get to work on the serum!

I'm speculating, but England is kind of infamous for being a nanny state. It's possible that she reported the fake accounts to FB (or people she know did) and at that point the state may be able to charge whoever owns that account, taking it out of the hands of the victim (same person in this case) to retract/cancel the charges. You can find similar actions in domestic abuse cases, where if the state become involved charges are pressed even if the battered party doesn't want them to be.
I copy pasted a mean "translation" of her photo caption (that a shitlord on here wrote) as a comment and got so much hate for it. A bunch of girls were like "you're just jealous!!!" Yeah. You caught me. I secretly want to be a lard beast. It's muh number one desire in life.
I would only ever find it sexy on a guy who could look way sexier wearing something else anyways.
The doc says they need to cut me open and drain them again...But seriously, if you listen to the commentary, they hired Meatloaf specifically for the role, and found out on the first day of shooting he had lost weight and was down to 200 lbs. so they put Meatloaf into a fat suit.
Jack Daniels is the furthest thing from classy. Jack Daniels makes me punch people in the face. I almost tried to fight a black guy at a country music concert after funnelling it. Really classy, eh? But I noticed hams that somewhere possess a vagina under their mounds of lard gravitate (or it gravitates toward them) toward the flavoured vodkas. Like, the skittles, raspberry (only time they taste fruit), birthday cake, etc.
Good point, I didn't think of that but then again which business isn't cut throat?? Again I am extremely angered for you, I just want to fucking tell fat fucks to look at the consequences. Its an easy fact that we have more reason to create a movement against overweight-morbidly obese people, than the ham planets do to have HAES. Im starting a non-profit for this movement. Were can I start preaching to fatties??
What are the dolphins that have a big forehead? They look like that, but the dolphins are made to be like that, that creature should be burned alive for however long it would take.
I'm worried people would think I'm fat, because I have a mohawk. The woes of a punk girl in the tumblr era :/
Oh my god, the one about wearing size 14 pants in middle school. When I was fat in my early teens, I also wore size 14 pants and YES IT *WAS* THAT BAD! It was not "kind of chubby," it was obesity!
Well I have a 12 inch waist! I'm so petite and dainty and waify and I only eat once a week.
And of course she has that bitch face as well...
Peck the neck and watch the lard spill
Click "unsubscribe".
Really?? :O I mean, yes, these people are obese, but nowhere close to the the gargantuan people I see on these subs!! And these are, like, the ABSOLUTE FATTEST people I know.
Hah, awesome, they purposefully built that corridor to eliminate people who couldn't possible ride. Of course there will always be people like her who are not quite planet size who can squeeze and shove their way through.
Each of them would weigh the same as a three year old child.
hahaha I love this place!
I agree. I am just saying that commenter who claimed the child was being crappy is basing that on assumption.
You can take that back. Its okay. I'm good.
Godammit A_S, if ever a thread needed eye beach. You fucked up.
Really? I know pre pregnancy she was definitely big but that's a grace period for women imo. Now I think her body's great.
I like how toward the end when they are talking, Trainor says that she couldn't keep up with Julianne.
You have a right to enjoy whatever the fuck you want as a fat person.I have the same right to make fun whatever the fuck I want.What doesn't it get?
That is obviously wrong, she must weigh more that that.
to make intercourse with your mom legal? what are you asking m8
Dizzy dizzy dinosaur
Someone track down that gentleman so I can buy him a pint. She expects the world to bend itself to her will and sounds more entitled than anyone in her little saga.
And the fucking bitch just laughs about it...That dog looks miserable.
Go to costco if you really want to rage. The fattest asses in america are there and blocking your way as they wait to scarf down the free samples
What's the point of a pretty face if the other 90% of you is gross?
These pathetic losers would never survive five minutes if they lived 500 years ago - they would probably struggle even fifty years ago.
This website tells you whats a good waist size for your height :)URL
I'm looking around this place and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing you guys. At least ham is going to try and change it, surely that's the goal? Don't hate the fatty, hate the laziness.
I'm 21 weeks pregnant today and my doc said an extra 300 cal a day starting with the second trimester - she was encouraging more because of my hypoglycemia and she doesn't want me to continue getting dizzy or passing out during the day.I've only gained about 6 lbs so far but I'm working out 4-5 days still and eating healthy. To get the extra 300 cal I'm eating some more fruit or some low fat dairy.I don't want to be a hambeast during my pregnancy - I'm already having a hard time with the little weight I have gained. It's not that I am uncomfortable but I feel so awkward - I honestly don't know how fat people can feel like this and be okay with it.
It's better to come here in the summer when it's stupid hot, because the fatties die out or cower alone in their miserable homes.
Edna hahahahahahah
Don't hang your head OP, that song is great.

Fat hate kills? No honey... fat kills. Hate to break it to ya.
"Ground control to jimmies: please respond.""There's no reply, sir. His jimmies have escaped earth's orbit. They're gone."
Not only fat but retarded enough to be Ariana Grande fans.
Most gyms have rules about using your camera in the locker room
&gt; because the 32s don't have enough room when I want to pack my gun with meThat's why I wear 32x30s instead of 30x30s. A big part of the solution was going to the CompTac Minotaur IWB. Super comfortable, super flat against the side too.
They need to understand if they are working on losing weight they need to take body shots when they lost the weight.
I love how she completely ignores him and just laughs. Thank you Janice.
Reminds me of when my overweight, diabetic colleague brought his overweight toddler to work because the kid. Our other colleague (also overweight) asked if she could bring him to the kitchen for a donut. The kid ate a large donut. Then my coworker took the kid to a doctors appointment and brought the kid back from work with McDonald's. I was dying inside.
Junk Food = Food in the minds of hambeasts.They literally have no idea what is in the food they eat. They don't understand carbs, sugars, protein, fats, calories etc. Most of them have absolutely no concept of nutrition!
happens to the best of us. :)edit: friends fo sho
ooo D was the wrong answer. correct answer was choice A, dumbasses!
That's not the same person. The first image is a model. I don't want to break rule 1, but if you do a reverse image search, you can find this image on Model Mayhem. So unless the FB profile is for that model, the ham is a different person.
Her and all the people who donated should be shot
Hey don't judge! Maybe he's gonna build some condos on all that acreage.
I've seen people actually read on an elliptical/treadmill. They must be reading the only thing that interests them, a fitness mag or their camero owners manual. /s
good lookin out buddy.
Four people, five and a half chins.
She would make vegetables illegal and make sure that there is a Burger King on every street corner with four in all airports.
Action Bronson is fat as fuck though
I am 5'10", 150 lbs, and have about 6% body fat last I checked. Jeans fucking cut into my stomache. why? because I have horrible posture. and because I wear jeans that are little too snug. Just saying, it might not be because they're fat and maybe just be because leggings are comfy. just maybe....idk don't hurt me please...
Well good on him for trying. I seriously hope he makes it.
If your internal organs weren't being crushed by the sheer amount of weight your fat creates around them (which they DEFINITELY are), they sure are now!
"We're in SIXTH GRADE." (And making more valid points than you)
Unfortunately, there is always someone or a hamplanet that would tap that. Fucking gross.
Good god, her head is going to implode like that episode of GoT with the Mountain.
Was the first thing i thought of! Why in the heavens would an employee write this on the recipt for the costumer? Everybody knows that fat people are whiny af and do everything to collect some 'i feel you' - points, even post it on facebook. No way an employee would risk his/her/xhe/whatever job in this kind of way. I think this is a post for r/thatHappened.
Oh there's a quick guaranteed PERMANENT way to lose weight. ಠ‿ಠHow much would you say a leg weighs?
I had to take two semesters of nutrition classes for my BSN, is it really that bad for MDs?
Really? All I can picture is them getting stuck in the tunnels.
I can do that one too. Also around my wrist where they overlap by well over an inch and I am a 5'7" woman of 50.
Hams always thinking of them selfs, but I guess it's hard not too when you take up that much space and resources. Did she think that because she has that large of an ass guys all want it!?! For some reason I imagined that lumpy, barge of an ass playing basketball. So thanks for the bleach
Kinky.
And possibly the forklift.
Girrrrl, you *know* that's going straight to your thighs.
She makes the bride look normal sized and the ham in purple look downright petite.
I got fat when I was 18 after being super thin through high school. I hung out with people who said I was beautiful, I was hit on by men fairly often. I had no reason to believe that I needed to change. In fact, I don't even remember why I started losing weight, but I did. That was 10 years ago, before Tumblr, but I hung out with people who acted like that so I could easily have fallen into the mindset but I didn't and I like to think that nobody here would have either.
We've been over the drinking your calories thing and she thinks that substituting apple juice is an ok way to cut out soda. Not when I find a 1/2 gallon empty every fucking day. I showed her how many calories are in the apple juice and then explained how many pounds of fat that adds up to in a year and she went to teas and water for a while but the juices are back.
Lmfao. The caption, hahaha, I'm dying :loudly_crying_face:
In all seriousness, each one of those butterfinger cups has like 150 calories, and each package has 4 of em. if I had to gain 500 pounds for some godforsaken reason I'd just eat those things all day
I love this bot
Not a single one amongst the employees, but that's none of my business.
That wasn't enough warning.
It would be better if he himself displayed the flag correctly stars go it the upper left corner unless it is fixed to a moving object( plane, tank, uniform) in that case the stars always point to the front to symbolize moving foward
woosh
That was terrifying. First I pretended to be taking selfies, but actually using the back camera. Then I was walking past it to get off, and snuck another, then ran off the train. She looked at me all confused, then the train drove away. Almost had a heart attack when I saw her looking though.
&gt;collideJust bet everything on the hams this time, shitlords.A true lock.
Ugh! This costume is about as lazy and shitty as the Nigri pikachu, but at least the ears/tail took a little bit of work. (That cosplay is really weak, I have called it out a few times with friends and other cosplayers. It is a bra, belt, and stripper skirt at its core. But I digress..)
And, of course, it goes without saying they don't know what the word 'health' means.
5'2 180 LOL.She forgot to mention her pre-lunch, pre-dinner and pre-snack snacks
Yeah but I'm not tryna stand the whole time
When you put it that way, I will probably cut their hands off and then later on decapitate them. No one disrespects Durin the 1st, lord of all.You are the first person ever to talk about dwarves/lotr without me initiating it, it made my day, thank you :) . Now I have some nostalgia going on, had to listen to this [first](URL
His grandfather....whom he ate
That's fucked up.
BAHAHAHAHAHAHA
It certainly is. Eater Dinkpudge.
I would love if they had the old scales, not the digital ones. That way the nurse or whomever is taking the weight has to slide over the little weights.
:-*
Fat drag queens are a testament to the fact that obesity makes you genderless. They seem so much more convincing than regular sized drag queens because fat chicks don't look like chicks to begin with.
the kid is actually normal size for some fucking reason
Right? HAES and pacemaker... I just... what?
LOL. Yes.
I'm actually impressed at the Constanza that was shopped in. I mean you bothered to refine edge and decontaminate colors.
Was just thinking the same thing...
Ignorance is bliss in this case.
I really hate that this BULLSHIT is an ongoing fad. I cannot wait for this to stop. Either that or we (the thin) will be slowly turned into slaves because these fat fucks can't tend to themselves. The Horror!
How is her face uglier in the "before" photo? I'm so confused.
LOL! Oopsie!
Or bread dough that's been rising for too long.
a beautiful excerpt from xer blog :: *Trans women are women. Some trans women have penises. Ergo, some women have penises. So when you insult penises/testicles/etc. in general, you are attacking other women’s bodies. How is this pro-woman? How is it feminist? (Radscum needn’t bother replying to this, obvs.)*WHEN YOU INSULT PENISES YOU ARE ATTACKING OTHER WOMEN'S BODIES
This happened in a Simpsons episode! When Homer joins a fat acceptance group, and then he realises how bad it is once the guy who ran it died of obeastity. Yay for shitlord Simpsons.
This is her heartbeat when her sleep apnea kicks in: &gt; ____
mmm...sounds repulsive. Do tell?
I also have the motivation to eat a whole fucking cake AND run it off
Yup the right looks like she's got no panties on. Hottt
My mom can relate to you. She is your height and 95lbs when she got pregnant with my oldest brother. She gained 20lbs and lost it right after giving birth. Same with my older brother too. With me she gained 40lbs (she didnt know she was pregnant being so tiny) and lost it all in 4 months. She was lucky and got no stretch marks. But, moral of the story is, no woman needs to gain 60+ lbs while pregnant. Be healthy for the baby. And the real woman thing is so stupid. I don't even know wtf that is supposed to mean.
I was so furious reading a similar story recently where a pregnant woman with health issues gave up her scooter for someone who happens to be fat. Great to read that you didn't give in to that brazen entitlement.
This can pretty much be said for anyone who goes into any sort of teaching/counseling profession. You pretty much can only work for that tiny percentage who actually get it.
I was about to call this pic douchey but realized I also have an ab pic on my tinder profile so.....I guess I have nothing to say here.
I'd at least want one good hit before!
Are you sure she would be? I thought tumblrinas hated Jews for some reason, too much privilege or something. Or maybe I'm just behind the times. It always seems like they switch focus once it becomes too trendy to hate on one group or another.
I believe the I is Intersex, which was before hermaphrodite. Not really male or female in terms of genitalia.
&gt; I also couldn't swallow pills until last year without the same type of reactionI have this too. I don't have major problems with food though (except raw tomatoes. Raw tomatoes are from hell. And problems with goopy textures, they also make me gag), but I've always had problems swallowing pills, any size. As a kid, my mom didn't understand why I was never able to swallow them. She would have to either grind it (when possible), or just wait till I could actually pass it, not without a lot of gagging and sometimes vomiting because of the gag.As a teen I learned to use the gag reflex to actually swallow the pill. Put the pill on mouth, drink water, look up, gag, swallow water with pill. That's the *only* way I can do it. I'm 34 now and I still do it this way. I also can't hold anything in my mouth without triggering the gag reflex. No matter how big/small/heavy/light.Related to the pill issue, I don't swallow anything I can't chew first. I even chew liquids. That's probably why I have problems with pills. I just mention this because you're the first person I know besides me who has the same issue with pills.
Why not? [It's perfectly safe, too.](URL
I hope someone shows these videos to him when he's lying on his hospital beds dying. Just so he realizes.
That ain't meat. We trim most of the fat from our meat.
Or left-wingers (like yourself) typing out what they think right-wing looks like, much like the false threats made in GamerGate.
Well if you give it a Twinkie , make sure you give it to her in front of her ( hopefully skinny ) friends. But I agree no reward.
Do you notice that all the fat tubblrinas always do this weird thing with their eyebrows where they have a worried expression? Is that supposed to be cute? If only they were as worried about their fucking weight
I know. Always cracks me up -- "I posted this for the entire world (literally) to see, and some people have the nerve to speak up? Why, I NEVER! Heathens!" Honestly...
Next time they ask you why you do what you do, ask them why they don't. That is clearly the better question. You are the healthier person so why aren't they trying to be like you?
This has become a major problem on base lately. The fat-ass dependents clog the gym to the point that it resembles their own arteries.
Leangains, look it up! It can work!
Fuck you op for exposing me to this revolting ham beast... At least provide some eye bleach..... Ahhh
&gt; Can someone explain /r/fatpeoplehate? Is it satire?lol you made an account to ask this dumb question.
But I've never done meth or heroine, god damn it I want pats on my back and praise all day every day for how safe I'm being!
We've all had our fair share of internet fights with her. She's completely insane. URLSorry for the boarder it was made for IG.
I don't think so.I... I happen to *like* beanbags :(and this I do not like.
Like, omg, cankles and fupa are so in right now.
The comments are riddled with fat sympathizers in that article. Fat shaming works, morons. The fats that get depressed about being called fat are weak humans in general. if they commit suicide over something that is changeable then they have made our species stronger. They would rather off themselves and blame others rather than take responsibility for themselves and change.

Edit: pm, not post. Duh.
That no one wants to fuck
It's a nice change of pace to see some male-centric posts. The delusion isn't as loud but just as strong.
If half the energy used to downvote was used to go for a walk..
Waste of oxygen. What a worthless being.
Well technically they called the clothes sexy, and I bet that same outfit shrunk down and fitted to a normal sized women would be sexy.
Wonder how many chairs he broke before finding that bench.
What a fucking obeast cunt. There are actual people in need while this ducking lard brings in 26,000 in benefits!?!? Bitch
Yet they spell marginally better than the Chic-Fil-A cows...
As the Bringer of Butts, my soul is gagging.
This post isn't involved in Fat Hate..... WTF
Rebel Wilson?
&gt;visibly starving. It's bodies on top of bodiesAgain, you are strawmanning. I am completely accepting of the fact that people starved, largely as a result of Allied bombing. &gt;gassing chambers (like Krematorium I in Auschwitz) were converted into air raid bunkers late in the war and converted backExcept that there is little evidence to suggest the bunkers were in fact gas chambers. The plans for the camp have them labeled literally as "corpse cellars"; morgues. &gt;documents and recordsWhich are all "missing" or "detroyed"&gt; how the fuck would that kind of an operation happen?Not too difficult really. Extract some confessions with torture, build a chimney, and there ya go. &gt;all a typhus outbreakTyphus wasn't exactly uncommon, with no vaccines availablen and lower health standards. Note that more than a single outbreak occurred. &gt;that only killed prisonersWhere did I even make mention of this? Naturally, as there were far more prisoners than guards, more prisoners would die, especially when guards were given superior living conditions.&gt;you realize that not just jews died in the holocaust right? Of course. Note how Jews are careful to especially emphasize their share while downplaying the treatment of others.
My wedding dress had one. I'll never, ever wear one again tho bc I learned the hard way that they impossible to untie without help. (Maybe some ppl can do it, but I was struggling so hard that I had to get a random person in the hotel untie me bc my husband was passed out.) It wasn't uncomfortable, but it's not something I would really ever wear.
Why do you think the flames off hell burn eternally?It's all the FAT FUCKS who wind up there.
Me too, running is awesome! I owe so much to this sub for the postive impact it's had in my life &lt;3
Buttholes are discolored. You think the hams are just turning into giant buttholes?
&gt; I think the only good movie she was in was Precious.I never saw that one. Read the book. It was very depressing.
That was her shin. Oh I can just picture the nice water bubble and floaty pieces of tiny bone... hnnnng, such memories.
Well she does lift a lot of heavy cake and chocolate to her mouth. Sometimes multiple pounds in one "workout" session.
Sigh, hams. Less knowledgeble of how the world works than the flat earth society.
I'm only 5'4"... terrifying
Post in FPHGW and I'll let ya know ;)
Her husband looks miserable in the few pictures I saw of him. Also, what's the point of fat, ugly bitches wearing nice clothes? That would be like covering a turd in glitter and wrapping a nice bow around it. It's like, you're not fooling anyone turd.
I've only ever heard of it in passing….I sub to /r/Brogress not sure if it's similar but I'll have to check that one out now too, thanks!
Thats about a typical meal for me
I see so many fatasses at the Subway near work and each of them keeps ordering for at least three people. I'm the only guy who always asks for salad, and the fat workers there look at me like I'm making their lives hell.
everything in her power except quit buying shit and quit eating shit and hit the treadmill
Yeah...I remember trying with a 'friend' when I was younger and laughing our asses off because we could not figure it out. We were both small, maybe just not dedicated enough?
Would I want it? No.Would I be happy about it? No.Would I rather have healthy health care professionals? Yes.However, as many have already alluded to, you're likely to do yourself more harm than good by shitlording in the ICU, to say nothing of how some hamplanet nurse could easily take down all your personal info and sue you for harassment and "causing emotional distress." (As if THAT'S what's going to kill them)

I'm 4 years older than him and look 20 years younger than him lmao.
These people are fucking sick
What the Fuck is this shit. Do people not think anymore? The dad bod is a proxy, literally only a means to make dudes who suck at life and chicks who can't get fine men feel good about themselves. When has ANYONE actually looked in the mirror and thought "Wow this pudgy mess looks so sexy"? What a disgrace.
All this thing posts about is "eating healthy" and "working out". That mixed with tubs of icing as dessert. She has apparently been going to the gym for a year but just keeps getting fatter and fatter. So gross

Funny thing. JB smartens up, and others get dumber.
I've been as big as a 38 inch waist in the past. Now my stomach is perfectly flat from my rib cage to my pubis. Every single day of my life I've lived in the body that I've earned. The hot one simply took more work and dedication to earn.
Nice title
Has anyone noticed that fatties have a certain distinct looking cleavage?

Nothing like drawing attention to the exact fat pocket that you are trying to hide.
You look pretty great to me!
This makes me so angry.
Pet peeve: people who believe in miracle cures, fad diets, and other such bull shit.It didn't take 8 weeks for you to get so fat. Why do you think you'll get back to your old self in 8 weeks?

Being gay is not due to your experience, you dumb cunt. I knew I was gay by the time I was 11 years old even though 99% of my friends were male, I still knew I liked women. People just know. Just like you know you're straight, You know your gay. It has zero to do with deciding you're gay or straight with a sorting hat like in Harry Potter.

I don't give a shit WHAT the definition says. Being fat is not a disability. As stated in the original comment, you try living with one. It sucks when people lump you in with a bunch of fat lazy fucks. They aren't disabled, they're lazy. There's a difference.

Why even bother getting a dress at all when you look like shit?
Honestly, each of these points could be a post topic on its own. I generally think as follows, using your ordering convention:1. No other gods before me- I think the commandment goes beyond kneeling to false idols I think it has to do with worship, and I think it's pretty clear food has taken a place in these people's lives which God would have claimed for himself.2. Depending on your reading of the commandments graven images and no other gods before are often taken as the same commandment, with others being separated. If taken separately I'm less sure obesity is in direct violation of this one. I could make an argument that man is made in God's image, and the overweight self is an abomination of that image, but it feels as stretchy as yoga pants.3. It isn't don't blaspheme, it's don't take the lord's name in vain. It's thought to specifically refer to the hebrew name of God given to Moses by the burning bush, I am who I am (YHW). There was an oral tradition of only speaking this name once a year during Passover. I don't really think they've crossed this line.4. Remember the Sabbath and Keep it Holy- there are two key violations of the obese here; the Sabbath is a day of rest, which means to keep it holy the other six must be days of work. Their sloth has generally made observance impossible. The other key violation is that Sabbath is a day of abstaining- from work, from frivolity, and from overindulgence of various kinds. In modern society this is perhaps the move violated commandment, but it's still a violation.5. Honor thy mother and they Father- this is mostly a charge for obedience. It's placement is usually right after honor God himself, so it's implication is clear. But he doesn't say be obedient, he says to honor them. You correctly note that the charge has to do with carrying on a tradition, but I think it also goes far enough to impose a duty of meaningful participation on the community in a manner that would enhance your parent's standing. This is impossible given their size. 6. Thou Shalt not Kill- you're point is too far from the subreddit's tone. They are killing themselves. It's as simple as that.7. It's not no adultery, it's DO NOT COVET, in some traditions it's separated at this point into a. thy neighbor's wife and b. thy neighbor's goods. We tend to think of the obese who engage in FA as envious of other women, and TiTP would tend to reinforce this point. Coveting goods mostly has to go with greed, specifically for food, but also to all aspects of the normal lifestyle they feel entitled to, love affection, sex, and reverence in society as beautiful. 8. I don't for sure that they've broken the do not steal commandment. We all know that their addiction, like any, has a likely result of theft, but there is nothing I see inherent about obesity and theft being connected. 9. It's do not bear false witness against your neighbor. Lying is really too small a sin to hit the big ten. When a lie affects those around you, it escalates. "I eat healthy and still gain weight." "I'm both obese and healthy." "Come join my FA movement and you will get the life you want without effort." In many ways this is, far, far more destructive than any other part of their movement. Their lies to themselves have become recruitment material to drag others down with them.10. Since I combined the previous covets, ten is missing in the numbering tradition used above.
I think they are confusing rape with fantasy. Rape isnt sexy or passionate. They will beat you and break you until you can fight back then do whatever they want. Me and my so will have moments where he will see me or vice versa and we cant help ourselves. He wont take his hands off me and constantly tell me how hot i am and how much he wants me. I love those moments because i feel suuuper sexy after. But thats not rape. Its consensual sex. Rapists will not tell you that you are sexy. They will not call you beautiful. They will say horrible nasty things to you. Its about complete domination of a person. Even with "rape fantasy" there can be safe guards so the person dosnt actually get hurt. Real life isnt that way. Fatties need to understand that romantasizing rape isnt good for people who deal with it every day be it the memories or the scars. Its encouraging rapists idea of "well they probably wanted it". Its sick.
This is all that I see, URL
She didn't even win
lmfao the fucking coke box.
Full Churchill on her ass.
I would be real suprised if he even burned 50 calories. You need to jog for like 6 minutes to burn 50 calories, i don't know how many you burn doing 10 kind-of situps but probably not 50.
I'm still kinda confused on this subreddit. Theres quite a few posts which are straight up bullying, and then theres some good posts where obese people are getting called out on their delusions with "healthy weight" and "thin privilege". what's the focus?I do agree that pole dancing is still a cringeworthy thing to post on facebook regardless of your weight.
I burned 2600 calories before noon the other day....WHEN I RAN A FUCKING MARATHON.Honestly, is it that hard for them to get a fitbit or use RunKeeper to see how many calories they've burned? Is it that hard for them to just actually weigh out their food and see how many calories they are actually consuming? Is that that hard to go, after the first 5 pounds of weight gain "hmm, I shouldn't be gaining weight right now, that's going to slow me down, I should cut my calories and adjust my TDEE"?This shit annoys the fuck out of me. I'm also tired of seeing overweight people "running" half or full marathons. I see a lot more people walk the entire time (who also happened to be the hamplanets who had tech gear on that said "if you're behind me, you didn't train better! tee-hee"). A half or full marathon is a huge matter of pride, it takes so much work and dedication, and it's annoying to see people not take it seriously. You're supposed to improve yourself, your health, each time you tie up those shoes and start training for a race. Now it's become something like a walkathon.Sorry for the rant, but fuuuuuuuuuuck.
Thr old logic its funny as hell till it affects me.
From what I remember from a earlier posting of this, he was transporting flood gate parts while disregarding the fact he was instructed to always carry those with two persons and always use the stairs. Happened in Taiwan IIRC.  Sad but stupid.
you need to understand the psychology behind it. Their goal isnt to reward her, they are rewarding themselves. This routine is terribad. the only reason is it mildy impressive is because of her giant size. If a skinny person went out there and did this exact routine, she would be booed out of the building because the act and the performance both blow. listen to the first judge, she literally praises her "confidence." not one word about the performance because it sucked ass.Most people like feeling self-righteous and do not enjoy appearing like an asshole, because most people are mentally weak.They cheer this fat tub of lard because it makes them feel better about themselves. Like hey, im such a good person i am cheering for this fat ass and it made her feel good. It is almost like the thought process of the social justice warrior. Even if they dont care about the thing they are arguing for, simply arguring for what is supposedly the correct cause makes the SJW feel better about themselves.
I thought the same thing, but then I realized that fat men had FUPAs too; plus "pubic" and "pussy" are more or less interchangeable, but I've always thought that 'gunt' was better suited for fat women.
This is all true. Related comment - the moderately fat ones, not the humongous ocean beasts, are especially infuriating when it comes to their exercise avoidance. Some guy who is 40 pounds overweight could easily do a HIIT session. Hell, he could buy 20 pound dumbbells and crank out Steve Holman's 4X training in 30 mins or, if especially ambitious, one of Jim Stoppani's resistance band programs. As the fitness industry becomes further professional and scientific, it becomes even easier for anyone to start a program. Curiously, resistance from the ham planet has correspondingly consolidated and grown, albeit without a touch of empirical support for its claims.
To be fair, I was looking at the first bike photo :) although I did a 10-mile in 54 minutes a few weeks back. Not hardcore enough for a 2: 17 marathon (yet).[run calculator](URL

I came here to say exactly the same thing. I assume the guy is around 30 years old but he dresses like an old man, with bad taste. Literally the only people I have seen wearing ‘pink’ trousers are old men.He seems to think he is some sort of style guru when he just dresses like an OAP. Yeah it’s always some variation on Pink/orange as well.

I apologize, what i should've said was everyone gets a medal "mentality." Where you get the same praise for losing as you would for winning. In even some cases more praise for losing, like getting fat and losing 5lbs. They act like they climbed mount everest. Its that mentality that i think coddles the obesity epidemic and is apart of its blue print.

It's a very open and accepting religion. I liked the fact that there was no heaven or hell, and I've always believed in karma. It's basically a religion that says "Worship the Mother (our principle Goddess) however you feel most comfortable, and through which ever depiction you want. (I worship through Athene) The law of 3, which states whatever you do comes back threefold. Never force Wicca on anyone else. Reincarnation. " that's pretty much the beliefs. Also, use of magic is ***EXTREMELY*** misunderstood by 99% of everyone.

I'd call that losing water weight.
The irony of your username being that of a whale that was sent to the moon, oh lawd.
I just came from this thread and he says that he isn't fat and he actually ate the food through out the day. My brother is pretty slim and he could put away this much food and not gain weight. But then again my brother goes to the gym and works as a technician off-shore which sometimes is labouring. It doesn't seem unreasonable to eat like this once in a while

Hey now, we oppress twice as many fatties this way!
"We imagine their life is based on deprivation..." Hey, she finally mooed the truth. She has no clue what control is.
Oh I think there's definitely some weird compulsion behind their eating and food choices. I just watched super size me again the other day, there's no way they're actually enjoying that food.If my hair started to fall out I would definitely take a step back and reevaluate the choices I was making.Congrats on not using to drugs anymore!

Yeah, OMC is full of cry-babies.
Yeah? Dude, words hurt. It wasn't just the occasional 'unkind word' it was constant verbal harassment about my appearance (in particular my big eyes), getting told I was 'not a girl' (because I played sport and rarely wore dresses or skirts) and then getting badgered about my sexuality (having rude questions about my relationships and sexual activity, in front of other people who did not know about my sexuality effectively outing me to the whole school). I wish she'd have just hit me or pushed me because then she'd have gotten expelled for violence but instead she received warning after warning and never once was punished.

I also find they always over estimate their workouts. I saw once a person gave themselves 600 calories for walking for 30 min.... I get that when I run 5 miles abd change. . and then I give myself 100-200 calories extra.
What's her BMI? Idgaf if your fat goes into your thighs/butt/boobs it's disgusting.

Well, yeah. Fat produces estrogen, so hams have less testosterone and more estrogen, sometimes to the point where they are unable to breed. (Thank god.)
Why do they all have their nips pierced? Seriously, no one is going to see them so why bother?
If it makes you feel better, my wife's best friend is feeling pretty normal these days. It took awhile, but she has a normal appetite. She can't do things like count calories though or log workouts because it triggers her, but other than that she is fine. Good luck in your recovery though!
There was a tale in /r/fatpeoplestories about a woman who had gastric bypass surgery and her husband snuck in McDonalds to her immediately afterwards. She ruptured all her stitches and died a miserable death. People are so stupid.

I love your username :-°
he used to be a big ham too. at least he improved himself.
Prednisone is no joke. My oldest take 20mg per day for his DMD his appetite went up fast, plus it can delay puberty so he's got a prepubescent steroid filled boys desire for food, but none of the things usually used to burn it. We worked with his doctor and a nutritionist to find a healthy diet to keep him at a normal weight. If a boy with Duchennes can keep it off, so can anyone.

Well, it's really the enabling fast food companies who choose to flock on young, unstable countries faults. They basically made multiple countries obese, killing thousands. Well, it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Thats the thing... I understand the need for sugar from time to time. I too crave ice cream, or chips or deep fried stuff and I occasionally indulge myself. But I don't need to have it every single meal of every day. That is the definition of no self control.

I'm jealous, my parents think all fat people have glandular issues and it's "not their fault." They think I'm shallow for hating unhealthy, lazy, entitled waste of human space.
It's a convenient thought that aids them in maintaining their lifestyle. Change is too scary now that they've gone past a certain point. The work it would take to lose 100 pounds is simply too much, I suppose. It's easier to convince yourself a lie than put in the work it would take to change.
On my high school swim team, fatties weren't allowed. And when we saw the manatees at meets, they were always (ALWAYS) holding up the meet because they would still be swimming while the next heat was trying to start.
No, that's what Fat Acceptance is saying.

The damning chant of fat shaming led by one with a medically perfect voice rocks the lard beast to his very core. Teeth chattering from the crippling shame, waves of agony wash over him like fire across an oil slick. As the excuse gland of the beast rapidly swells, attempting to somehow portray him as the one ham that will be accepted here, Ninja-Kiwi cuts him off with a roar of denial. As the chant continues seperating the grease fused molecules that compose a butter golem, Ninja-Kiwi unsheathes the fabled *Shitlord's Slicer: The Obesity Cure* and his eyes narrow to apocalyptic rage bearing slits of determination. Hacking and swinging with reckless abandon, the beast is slowly and surely reduced to a grisly collection of skin and bones. Staring at the distasteful mess, the good doctor pulls from his pouch a high dose of Beetus Be-Gone, a solution that can remove even the porkiest of ham stains. Sprinkling the solution on, a sizzling fills the air as the potion does it work, cleansing the blessed lands of Shitlordia.

I think I walk faster than, say, 90% of the population. In trying to figure out why, the only explanation I've come up with is that I'm used to walking in heels. Now that I wear flats (shin splints!) I compensate for the tiny steps that heels require and I just go really really fast. But, yeah, crowds are awful.
Very interesting and informative - cheers!
I love how the girl posts half naked photos of herself on the internet for all to see and then expects no one to repost it on some creepy fetish blog. She should be thankful for any positive feedback her gross body gets.

Well done for being a flabby, ugly, lazy idiot, bra-fucking-vo...
Big targets are the best. There's more to aim at.
I'm using lean gains now (can't link to another subreddit you can find it). I find that MFP has the most exhaustive list of foods. I use it because I can track everything I eat pretty easily and see charts and stuff. The problem is when I workout I workout pretty hard (10-15km on off days; lifting and 3-5k on workout days). I know it's supposed to kill gains doing cardio but I want a healthy heart and by goal is to eventually run a marathon. So I have to make sure I'm eating at a surplus for my calorie burn which is tough because I refuse to train less.
I think Alabama still holds that title, with Louisiana a close second.
The best part about this is that it demonstrates just how futile the efforts of fatties to look good by wearing loud and avantgarde clothing is. Outclassed by a shitlady wearing jeans and a tshirt.
I'm surprised he can stand.
That fatty is so huge, she's in every profile
C'mon, don't deny you secretly love the smell of your belly button cheese.
Amazing read, I mainly only come here for the stories because they're the most interesting anyways. Only problem I had with it was when you mentioned how they eat so much more than the average American. Unfortunately, most Americans eat pretty much the same and weight about the same as the lardies you mentioned. *C'est la vie in America now*

Secret shitlord yoga lady here. Yes its normal to use blocks and yoga straps. All depends on ones flexibility. But it doesn't justify this picture at allll
Being a a Type 2 diabetic that doesn't care about themselves make you an asshole. I'm Type 1 and the Type 2s that actually change themselves are good people. Sadly, both groups are small when compared to the rest.

It's so fat it turns baggy into form fit
We got in trouble for stuff like this before. Now we have to censor all usernames, facebook pages, instagram shit, tumblrs, all that.
That's so going on your tombstone
Ok she must have half of her "boobs" tucked under her armpits, considering they're facing outwards. :confounded_face:
I know where I'm going now! :3
And if you posted "met a girl on OKC, we hooked up and it was awesome" you would get nothing but "You lie!"
I think by saying it hadn't been through training it means it hadn't been used to teach new riders.

Holy shit, I never even knew that was a thing haha. Infighting with barefooters culture, god I swear only on reddit lol. But yeah, def good to get a feeling of a place before trying to contribute. I guess the best we can do is just what you did and give a polite tip to someone who obviously isn't familiar with certain things yet.
I think the discoloring can be attributed to poorly applied self tanner. What a shocker that a fatass would half ass something.

This is fucking funnyPoor kid though
If you guys were curious , did some quick calculations, and that pan of food is about: 4652 calories, or about 930 calories per serve! BEETUS CASSEROLE! lol
Um, of course you should? Skinny cishet white men wrote it? And filled it with oppressively wrong oppression definitions?
WHY DO REPULSIVE PEOPLE POST SELFIES? HOW DO THEY NOT KNOW THEY ARE REPULSIVE?
oh, ok, that wasn't even supposed to be a link tbh.
Usually you start to feel that from about 16 weeks, give or take. But, initially it can feel a lot like gas moving in your intestines.Given the horrors I imagine occurs in obeast plumbing, I imagine that baby movement is easily masked by gastrointestinal distress they all seem to frequently suffer from.However, later on, babies hiccup a lot, which is really distinctive. And then there's the feet and elbows they poke around. To not notice that is really bizarre to me.Source: mom x2
I hope this happens to Chris Christie
"I'd rather be fat and happy than skinny and miserable!!11!!"
Trust me, you don't wanna see that lol. I don't know about a 50. BMG but I could personally tell you what 12 gauge buckshot does to a hammy and it's not pretty.
We need to start a social movement, NOcase
Fuck off, fatass.Banned.
I really hope it is
That's some one sided warfare if you ask me.
Would someone please think of ma trigguz
The slug looks 40
Nice b8 m8.
I take the opinion that everything counts. Just don't let exceptions become the new normal. When I'm cutting and actually tracking, everything gets counted, I just get back on the wagon the next day.
I'm gonna need uh... some sources on that. For science.
They'd just catfish it
I was lucky enough to have a father like this when I was younger. Unfortunately, as he grew older, he grew more sedentary. Bought a post hole digger to make things easier, a couple beers on the weekend turned into beers every other day. Now he's struggling to lose the weight.I live abroad and didn't realize how much he had gained until I came back for Christmas. I sat him down when I was home and we had 'the talk.' The, 'I don't want to be a bitch, but I want you alive in 20 years, so get your shit together' kind of talk. Since Christmas he's lost 25 pounds. I'm proud, but worried he'll slip up again.Fuck.
With a strongly written letter!
I'm so confused by the picture of fat people having sex? Embracing? I have no fucking idea, I can make out a hand and that's it.

We'd still be able to battle and such, I just wouldn't be able to use Pokemon and moves that were introduced when ORAS came out (new megas, certain move tutor moves, etc).Plus, it's always nice to have more 3DS friends
I grew up with this guy AMA
Nasty bearded fatties. Trying to look like lumberjacks but looking like garden gnomes.
Omg I watched this a hundred times. Disgusting yet hilarious. Hilariously disgusting. What a fat fuck. I'd end my own life if I ever broke a table by sitting on it. And you can tell she has no muscle control since she can't lower herself slowly like normal people. Anyone else ever notice that? Fat beasts can never just sit down in a chair or on a bench without applying 1000 pounds of pressure per square inch...
She posts it on facebook? Wtf
Google.
The funny thing is, we could eat anything they eat (but why would you want to). The only difference being that we can portion it correctly and be fuller faster with our smaller stomachs! Hahaha eat that entire banana cream pie I dare you! I won't cry over food I choose not to eat, but you will cry over all the food you've consumed in excess resulting in your massive non-human disfigurement!
You're a bit of a fat faggot.
Damn, another YouTube channel I have to subscribe to.There's not enough time for all the glorious music.
I meant on the show. And the people who don't know for like the whole thing. At 8 or 9 months you should show a bit right? If you know after a while and still lost weight (bad morning sickness I assume?) that's understandable because you take steps to make sure baby is healthy.
Remove that S in the front and you got it, mate. ;)
Because she can't eat the ice cream cone on her phone.
How you liking it so far?
not even close... "i have a lot of fat friends, they're great"
Oh my christ. She is fot.
It takes two hours for them to find a place with no people so they can sit on the ground and snap a selfie with no other people around.
I'm a 5'4 and 125 lbs, and there's absolutely no way I would look like THAT if I gained 10 lbs. Also, she mentions in the "About Me" section that she does plus sized modeling full time. 5'4 and 135lbs does not equal plus sized, so clearly she's lying.
&gt;marine biologyWhich, in her case, would be genealogy.
Nothing wrong with the ole cow ring. Especially when it's on cows. But it does ruin it :( it's a nice piercing
What I find especially ironic is that this fucking morbidly obese sow photo shopped her gunt to make it smaller. I thought she was "loud and proud" of being obese! She'll never live to see 45 years old.
I'm down
Lol we're always in droughts and we just get wasted in tubes, you'll be fine in the water as you can stand in them easily. I'm also a hill bomber... lol. PM me when you get here, we can go play skateboards.

I will not be fat again. Fuxk that shit. I enjoy looking at myself too much
Oh god.
I've had to turn off anonymous asks on my tumblr, and I follow mostly fandom, art, and crochet blogs (okay, and porn). You just have to have a zero tolerance policy for bullshit -- I refuse to follow anyone who posts social justice warrior or fat acceptance nonsense.
Looks like a thimble on his fat melon.
180 lbs is about the ideal weight for a toned 5' 10-11'' male.
Umm..wut did I just read?
And separate swimming pools.
&gt; license was suspended.&gt; placard wasn't valid.Why is there even a question of "innocence"?! She had NO right of way to the spot, and then she attacked and injured an old woman. ARE YOU INSANE?

Those look like pregnancy stretch marks. They're light, which means that the skin was at time time stretched beyond the point it's at now. If they were from getting fatter and fatter, they would be bright red or dark pink.
Thank you so much for sharing your story and I *really* like your approach. Sounds like you may have gotten through to her. I wish I'd started shitlording sooner, too. It's the only thing that seems to work. I reminded my husband about what our pastor said to us in a pre-marital counseling session. Shitlord pastor was talking about how to have a healthy marriage and talked about meeting each others emotional needs, and then he moved on to physical needs. He said, "For god's sake, please stay active. Don't allow yourselves to get out of shape- please don't do that to each other".
Better have a dump truck to carry it all.
This is a beautiful answer.
Awareness, bitches.
That's gotta be embarrassing for the kid- lots of single parents doing well for their children, and this kid got stuck with the shitty one.

Or the one that is black out drunk trying to sleep in one of the bedrooms. If there was to be a study on female on male rape I would bet a decent amount of pesos on the majority of culprits being hamplanets. Predatory hamplanets who seek out house parties in the hopes of catching their unfortunate victims incapacitated, literally unable to resist their currrrvvvvvves. "He wouldn't be able to resist these currrrrvvvves if he was conscious anyway." "He is a man, of course he wants some of this" while rubbing her hands down her massive, massive, MASSIVE body, licking her lips in anticipation of the rare sensation of a healthy body in contact with her blubber. Earlier at the party this now passed out man might have said something to the horny hamplanet, likely it was a request for her to move her massive body as it was obstructing the mans path but all she heard was "damn I love a REAL woman. I was beginning to think that this party only offered disgusting skinny anorexic sluts who do not know how to treat a real man." Thus the dye was cast. The mans only chance of remaining rape free is to go home but alas he had no chance, he had no idea that his uttering the words "excuse me" to a hamplanet would change his life forever. He would awake from a horrible nightmare in which his whole body was being crushed by some unseen force to the real nightmare of being crushed by a sleeping whale. His poor half-boner trapped inside the endless folds of the foul smelling "real" woman. It would take the combined strength of 8 full grown men in their prime to roll the now sleeping whale off of its victim. As the men labored to roll the giant mammal and free the poor man they noted that she had the most tranquil expression below the excessive amount of makeup, the sweat, and of course unbelievable amount of fat on her face. “Does she dream of endless all you can eat buffets?” Perhaps she dreams of crowds of real men admiring her currrrrrvvvvvves” “Maybe, just maybe, she dreams of both” the men asked themselves.Once the now traumatized man was free they quickly discovered that he had suffered a few broken ribs and some kind of fungi infection had colonized his penis during its stay in what can only be described as hell on earth, the deepest recesses of the whales rolls, a place that has not seen the sun since the brief time before the whales DNA activated the masses of fat cells to grow from air.Fuck it thats enough of that. Hamplanets are gross.
Fat people hate. She's fat. The only place pregnant women should gain anything is stomach, boobs, and ass. Not thighs and arms. Bitch is fat.
She ate the pinky.
She's not wearing her seatbelt.
That is far as hell :(

LOL still ew though.
So I've been seeing more and more shitlording in my local news sites, and some major world news outlets lately too. This article treat was near the top of the Latest Popular Headlines on my BBC feed and thank fucking god! I was beginning to think that most people were becoming too PC to call out the fat bullshit. Please let this be the beginning of lardlogic getting shut down and calling someone Fat becoming acceptable again.
Been a while since I've looked at some family photos, thanks for posting!
They don't have this fucking narcissistic, whiny shit in China. And the U.S. wonders why it's second now. Because we've let the garbage get out of control.
It's hard to believe that's a real human being.
It's impressive. I couldn't imagine putting that sort of weight/stress on my knees every single time I wanted to stand up or walk around.
Will send it to you when I get off work. Unfortunately that is around 11pm but I won't forget
I disagree, OP. You said "You tried :(". Clearly, she did not. Even a beautiful lady would look like shit in this... horror.

Sure thing. You're exactly the same as me. Jerk jerk you faggot.
No, I banned that cunt.
Well I'll live longer than her, get to experience romance with someone who's actually attractive, won't have to go to tumblr/Instagram for reassurance that my body is okay, and can see my fucking toes so I'd say she's worth less than people who stay fit.
This should be the go-to story for every hammie who claims they can't lose weight. Especially if she has that glandular disorder.

Maybe you misunderstood? The point I was trying to make is that people are quick to call someone a bully as defense as quickly as people throw out the race card.I'm not saying shitlording is akin to racism. We all hate fat fucks no matter what the race is.
Coincidentally, she probably weighs as much as the zebra she skinned and ate to make that atrocious costume.Also, check the window. I see at least two more hambeasts. Not sure how long that floor can last.

Shopping for my 6'4" fit boyfriend, I saw a shirt that he's been wanting. The comments all said "it's a snug fit" and "it runs really small"... So I ordered the next size up and he's literally swimming in it.
Send a pretty model too.
This is truly, truly disgusting, first fat pussy I've ever seen (hard to believe I know) and I think it'll be the last.
damn misread the title, thought it said her Instagram was goldmine as a username lmao
Use it in a sentence!"If you are what you eat, that fat avacado looks like she ate about 2000 pounds of guac from Chipotle."
Yeah, I would be fucking devastated if something like that happened to me. This is totally a "that happened" story.

I LOVE the metabolism excuse.anytime someone uses it just point out that heavier people have HIGHER basal metabolic rates because their body has to work harder to lug all the extra poundage around.
Necrotic feet are just one of those weird, funky things that bodies do! Embrace it! (/s!!!!) Seriously, though, the smell must be horrific. From the beast in general, but especially from its decaying, encrusted hoof-rot.
It sounds like your knowledge of food is quite screwed up. Organic is meaningless. IIFYM
The thing that frustrates me the most about the idea that "diets" can cause health problems is that even if they do have negative side effects, they dissipate so fast with healthy eating. Back when I was extremely disordered with my eating and I was starving myself I had heart palpitations and hair loss, but now that I am recovered I wouldn't even think that I ever had those symptoms. Symptoms of obesity are much more likely to be permanent.
&gt;You know how they say the grass is always greener on the other side? Well, for us thin people, it is. Naw. The grass is definitely greener on the fatty side. Dead bodies make great fertilizer and obesity is a better indicator of early death than smoking.
I cannot answer for sure, since I have a penis, but it could be to help them go. You know, running water and all.
Have to take away those fake internet points! That'll show 'em!
A salad bar.
it seems like someone is starved for attention and feels guilty about it so they contrived a story about an imaginary person who is even more starved for attention, so much so that they'd ask a pregnant woman to move in front of her significant other, no less. it likely made OP feel better so they wrote this stupid story. i can't believe how many people upvoted this piece of shit post.
Well its hard to give cancer to cancer.. So
Somebody may get SO BUTTHURT they track your personal info down and then attack you in real life and try to fuck shit up.

Keep in mind that these are often what the women that constantly rant and rave about being street harassed and about neckbeards or whatever else . Lol. Whenever a female posts on this site, folks picture some 10/10 but most are no different from the typical image of what the average make posters look like
Did she actually fucking say she "would be *more than happy* to get fat"??? Fuck her and fuck this world.
Wtf is it doing?
It's because they're fat pieces of shit and they think they're better than everyone else just because they take up more space. They deserve to be shamed, fucking glutenous pigs have no right in preaching about health to anyone.
Yeah that thing is random, I used photos of me and my friends 24-25 and it guessed from 30-51.Never smoked, never fat... wtf I'm not OLD!!! T-T

They can't control it. After a certain point in the development to a fat fuck, their mouth just drops open at the slightest hint of human interaction because they are just clinging onto the hope that someone might chuck some food in there.

They're also hijacking industries once reserved for fit people : modelling, fitness instructing, dieticians. And they'll make tons of money because they appeal to the largest (heh) and growing demographic (in the US at least): overweight and obese people. A fit person would only trust a fit instructor when it comes to exercise, who do you think a fat fuck will give their business to? Someone who gives them the warm fuzzies.
I got organic chips and hummus. Luckily I watched it with my SO and just ended trying to procreate instead.

Its CLEARLY genetics. (She probably says to everyone who asks)I bet she just looks at her fat as hell family and keeps saying to herself "well at least I'm not THAT big"All the while stuffing her face with burgers.That's the worst for whales.

It is kind of magical how it is able to squish all of that blubber smaller, making it even more repulsive than it was before.
A psychologist sits and listens with a masters in psych and a license for therapy. A psychiatrist listens with the same credentials, but is also an MD and can prescribe medicines.I've met a lot of both. The only obese psychiatrist I ever saw got me hooked on very dangerous pills and I have been withdrawing for over a year and even went to the hospital. Conclusion: if the person prescribing you meds is an EatBeast, they obviously don't care about their body, so they certainly won't care about yours. GTFO and see a skinny doc.
I'm sorry dude. Some thrift stores and dollar general stores carry scrubs(I'm poor) so you might want to call or check. That's the reason I can't buy anything online amymore. You try to figure out if the women that say it runs small are squeezing into a tiny shirt or if it really does run small. More often than not, they are lying to themselves.

One theory is that the "Venus" figurine was created by a woman as a depiction of herself. No mirror was available, so she simply looked down at herself. Hence the skewed proportions.
A dead whale had washed up on the beach. Decomposition can create a lot of gasses and dead whales can and have exploded before (several examples on Youtube). In this instance the guy was trying to cut a vent to let the gasses escape safely but it had already built up too much pressure and it popped like a balloon.

If you fantasize about it I'd say go for it bro
She claims they video chatted, yet she didn't know what he looked like or who to look for when she was waiting on him. She's lying.
Good for you. You sound pretty!
Be banned and happy while you're at it. Did you consider the option of being skinny and happy? Cause that's a thing also.
That's what you get for fucking with a hammy hugbox. Enjoy your new cardobard box, *Jeff*.
Similarly, when I was in college I spent 2 years being an inactive lazy shit. All I did was go to class, play league of legends and eat shitty food and drink while being in a terrible relationship. I gained 4 pounds by the end of it..

They didn't. There is a reason I said MINOR. I'm simply saying that genetics are not completely irrelevent. I swear, this sub is the worst hivemind I have ever seen.
Well, he is obeast too
The denial, shame, and self loathing reminds me of the way addicts think and talk. I've struggled with addiction for a couple of years now, so I can almost sympathize with this. It's gross, but sad.
Same here.
For one OP said he and his brother were talking, not that they were trapping the bartender in the conversation. Second, he says they talked about how "cute" her body is, not fuckable or bangin. This is 100% people looking to be negative about a situation that isn't a negative.
There's still time for her to change
No room for stuffing, it's already Cadbury Creme filled
These photos are the only argument we need to bring back capital punishment.
I love how she said that whatever size you are if you're happy then that's great but that she doesn't believe anyone that's fat is actually happy. This is so true, they are just kidding themselves. They'll continue to have 'healthy' indicators like BP etc.. in the short term. But the kidding will stop on that first visit to the doctor where the doctor says 'it's not ok anymore. Remember how i said it was a risk? well it's a reality now.' Then, they'll get it. And they'll lament that they ever accepted themselves and kid themselves into thinking that they were happy at that weight, which was so much less than what they weight now. Now that it's too late. And that's really sad. And that's why FA and HAES has to stop.
Probably the 5 hours a day they spend on the shitter.

In 10 years, this man will run a fitness empire that will be our answer to planet fitness. If we can just get over the Christian thing, then we can have a shitlord paradise of our own.
Good idea. There were others there, so I can ask them if he was flirting/touchy with her. While I was there though, he was pretty neutral towards her.

Oh my god in the third picture her rolls made it look like she wasn't wearing...umm...bottoms. Also that dirty dirty rash and discoloration on her ass/inner thigh looks like the product of being unable to wipe for the past 20 years.

It might be cliqued to say, but I always imagine shipping the fatties off to poor areas in the world. Imagine what a starving African child or child from an Indian slum would think when they met a lardbeast like her.
Fat cunt...embrace that.
lol I can dead lift your moms fatass so I think I'm doing just fine. 100 kilos Is nothing, try harder tardo.

Did you see what the retard said to me? There wasn't much of a better response....I see nothing wrong with using "really" in response to something absurd or stupid. I think you're overthinking things. And fuck yes I am an ageist! I am a proud one that thinks if you're under the age of say 25, there are very few things in life I will listen to you talk about and actually value it
Lol
&gt; I'm genuinely concerned about some kid I don't know.I hope this eases your concern:She is a very happy, healthy, curious child who adores being read to. She can't walk yet but she'll definitely be a climber and join her Auntie (moi) on many wall climbing and horseriding adventures when she is old enough.She's super smart and, while she's not talking yet, she responds properly to many things in two languages (she is being raised bilingual).She's treated like a princes but has plenty of boundaries.She is too young to understand what is going on and her parents care enough about her to not hash out their problems in front of her in case they cause stress.I've never heard her laugh because she always chuckles like an old man and makes everyone else laugh.She was asleep when this incident happened and I took care of her when she needed a bottle (didn't want to interrupt his epic rant).Her mother loves her more than she loves herself.My parents (and I) would kill her my sister before they'd allow her to harm her, emotionally or by making her fat and unhealthy.
Lack of confidence. I'd rather be forever alone than to deal with Shamu.
Ya, what is that? Is this a real thing in very overweight people?
The fatties half ass every pose they do, it is pathetic to look at. But somehow they will use the excuse "it's mostly muscle" if someone brings up their fat. I know damn well I don't come close to the strength the fit girls doing yoga have, so how the everloving fuck can your rolls be muscle.
At the same time, if you eat 1200 calories a day, it doesn't matter how much you lift, you aren't going bulk up.
I love how they were the ones attacking you and you got banned. Welcome to the club, the defaults are full of whiteknight fatasses. Shit, I got banmed from fatpeoplestories for roughly the same thing.
I love you too, calm your tits &lt;3
Why? So she can eat me?
Crabs in a bucket.
all negligence means is "failure to take care proper care in doing something".the author isn't giving them any kind of "out". just pointing out that they eat negligently, which is to say they pay no mind to the effects that overeating will have on their bodies.
Thank you.
Stay in your fucking room Elsa, I'm going to go get laid. -Anna.
Someone needs to find that motherfucker a weight loss cheat code.
LOL I can't even imagine putting my BELT right under my boobs...that's the strangest place to call "natural waist" ever. But then, I guess when you're SO FUCKING fat, there's not many choices on the body to call "a waist"
I completely agree. Light ranch kind of sucks.

I workout a lot. I'm in pretty good shape--not like the models in Men's Fitness Magazine. But I tell you, I'm a lot closer to one of those guys then I am to a hamplanet.
I know this is a ridiculous question, but what does SRS mean?? I see it here a lot but am lacking in this new fangled lingo. ....watch it be something like Shit Redditors Say...
Or if you're sedentary just counting them and know that at some point you'd better have vegetables for dinner and not too much breakfast for a few days.Everything is possible as long as you're self aware and understand actions have consequences.

Me too! Those kiwis look delicious.
nah, just a personal preference cause I don't really like the powdery feel of the yolks when it's hard boiled. :)
No no, take your compliment. Anyone who matters, you know, thin people, still use the word correctly. Roads are curvy. A woman with a healthy fit body, who has hips, breasts, an ass, and some legs, is curvy.Round is not curvy, it's curve.
It's only a matter of time before her body engulfs her entire head.
Ha Ha yeah I was so confused with the size 0 as well.
My husband had a co-worker at another job who weighed over 300lbs. She had several miscarriages, and her dr told her point blank she needed to lose a lot of weight if she wanted kids. There was no mincing about the fact that her morbid obesity was the issue.
well, one's fat, the other's a Guido.
Don't google that...
I love this picture. This picture is amazing.
If you had read my other post in this same thread, you would know that I understand that athletes need a higher calorie intake than the average person. You're verified, so I know that I needed fuck with you. Calm down.

That has to be an ad for counter tops.The strongest fucking counter tops known to man.
It's not an exact weight more than it is a proportion, specifically with your sex and height in mind. Humans generally will have the same bone/organ mass at certain heights unless there is some mutation or deformity, so the BMI calculator is very useful for this. If your body fat percentage is above 25, you are already putting your organs under some strain, and the higher it goes, the more strain it will put on other parts of your body such as the joints, etc.
Yes, because just being outside naked is enough reason to ruin someone's life, have them scorned by the community, force them to move and make it almost impossible to get work.If I had to guess based on how the woman is holding clothes it was either some sort of suicide attempt or he is in shock from something. Either that or he's mentally ill.

why do fat fucks describe themselves as curvy, dont get it.
But she's been standing for three hours! She's exhausted! /sIt's really pathetic when they tire out from shopping. It's just standing and walking. If you can't do that all day without tiring yourself out, you are out of shape and need to start doing some cardio.
... she spelt the word "wanton" as "wonton". Y'know, like the dumpling?

So? What if you stop being friends with her or she goes on holidays or she has people over or literally anything else at all?You are already making yourself dependent on someone else. Your weight and exercise routine is not her problem. By all means, do stuff with friends to keep up the motivation *etc*. But don't be fucking waiting for them! Don't only do things when they can see you doing it.It might be fine for today, but what about tomorrow? Sort your own shit out and find a different sub to post in until you do - we'll welcome you with open arms when you have grown up a bit, taken control of yourself and are human-sized again.
That has definitely been my experience.
Forget breeding artificially fattened livestock. There's plenty of people willing to live that livestyle out of their own free will. Too far?
You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.
I think it's pretty bizarre how they just argued like children, "uh huh." "nuh uhh." "uh, Uh Huh!" " Nuh Uhhh!"Seriously? What are they, like 3?

"This is all the food I need to be healthy."
May I ask where you get yours? My favorite place (also sold clothes and some awesome jewelry :D) went out of business and I only own one corset and have had it for like three years and it's in a sad state of sadness : c and ugh. Theres a page that one of my facebook 'friends' follows and reposts from that's exactly like that, and they also sell spankies for like 40$ apiece. They're spankies -_- not magic fat fixers. I used to wear those when tumbling so the world didn't see my underwear.
I call bullshit .... That things doesn't have a female companion.
Fucking Whale-mart
Is that actually true? There's no disease or anything someone could have that would prevent them from losing weight?
Have you ever seen this TV show? It consists exclusively of people deep frying food (as a competition of sorts) which is especially popular at state fairs in the US. The channel it airs on generally appeals to lower class white Americans, so lots of shows featuring unhealthy food.
I believe it's hair.. Being extra fat probably makes you sprout a ton of it in places
Keto worked for me precisely because it requires very little willpower. If you feel full from filling fatty foods, you never feel "hangry" because your body can easily just break down body fat for easy energy, and you're not eating highly addictive carb loaded food you can lose weight stupid fast with almost no effort. There is no active need for willpower to enforce moderation, you simply feel no desire to overeat ever, food stops being an obsession and simply becomes an energy source.

in your comment history:&gt;Okay I am a 181 cm, 118 kg, 31 yo male. I walk 5 kms everyday, I do 10 mins of morning workouts everyday, which includes 250 crunches (moving the torso while my legs are pinned, I bought a special stand so I could do them), I eat one banana or one apple for breakfast, drink at least 4 liters of water a day, for lunch I have a salad and soup (no meat, just vegetable soup) and for dinner I have yogurt, I don't smoke, I don't drink. I CAN'T LOSE THE FUCKING WEIGHT, I've been doing it for an year and I have lost only like 3 kgs.Honestly, with this approach, most people here would probably hate you.
She's the happy, quirky, life of the party fat girl. The one that everyone luvs! In her own mind, anyway.At night she cries into a trough of ice cream, and a family sized bag of chips.

I know a woman who is quite thin, but she pops Adderall a few times a day and also does a lot of coke. She refuses to eat any form of vegetable or fruit, chain smokes and when she does eat, it's pretty much burgers, fries, pizza, etc. I don't think she's healthy at all and it will probably start showing more as she ages. I am not a health freak by any definition but I can't imagine living like that. It seems pretty gross to me.

That's about right. It's itty-fuckin bitty. The belly doesn't really start expanding a lot until the second trimester. This monster in the photo will be looking closer to Jabba the Hutt by her 9 month because you know she takes eating for two literally.
Your comment really struck something in me. That's exactly it. As much as I love seeing tumblr getting bashed, I only really glance at that sub from time time.Here? Here is home.
Both sides are wrong. They should change the name and the family should eat less.

No fucking way that's the same person.
That's exactly what happened to me. I was giving support to a woman who was gaslighted by her boyfriend into thinking that she was fat and was convincing her that it wasn't her fault for not knowing the warning signs. But I post in here with a comment about how flawed BMI is as a metric and it puts me on the ban list.
I knew from the thumbnail that it was her! Fuck that girl is so ugly
Or a hot knife through fat people
A mutual friend on Facebook posted that she was 240 lbs and a size 16/18, and that there was no universe where Tess weighed only 40 lbs more than her.She was immediately shouted down by other women, some of whom accused HER of lying about her weight. As though there's a single woman on earth who would claim to be 240 lbs for the hell of it.
&gt;Iron yet just ban hammerI'm exercising the just part. This is his first post to FPH and I'm hoping he stops the fat logic / bullshit and becomes a true shitlord (they usually don't but a few have.)I can definitely see why you'd want to ban him though.

That's a great way to put it.
Everything on the internet is true.
Good. Not only is sitting next to an obese person EXTREMELY detrimental to a human-sized person's trip, but it costs more fuel, food, space, etc. If a slightly-too-big bag costs money, why not a several-times-human-sized person?

I *hate* these people. I cannot STAND that they refuse to take care of their bodies. I have a goddamn congenital heart defect that gives me pain every. Single. Time. I exercise. I still managed to go to nationals in track and field. I still manage to become vice president of my university's dance club. Despite the fact I have to sit out every other song due to chest pain I've won some regional contests.My doctor told my in January that I am not allowed to do any form of exercise til I have my FOURTH open heart surgery. I've lost ten pounds since January and I have a hard time going up some god damn stairs.The fact that they can do all of this to theirs bodies while I WISH I could JUST be fat and have to work that off instead of having heart disease is an *INSULT*. It is an insult to me, and to everyone that wishes they could be healthier and not in pain. How dare their ruin their perfectly good bodies while I would do ANYTHING to know what it was like for a day to be really healthy, to not feel immense pain doing something I love dearly. This world is cold, callous, and unfair. Effyourwastedpotential.
True. Im fucking lazy in general (dont believe me check how often I dont proofread posts after submitting them on this small ass screen of a phone). Though, you must be way beyond lazy and irresponsible to not move. I played soccer and then I had 2 fucking chocolate donuts a gatorade (and not the Zero variety) and still went to the gym for a 10 minute bike ride and 20 minute elliptical. So you can literally be a lazy grease gorger who eats whatever you want so long as you make payments for it with movement.

I have this exact condition. I was fat growing up and lost weight last senior year in high school &amp; freshman year of college. Fuck all of you guys, shit was a hard ass battle that took time and effort and extreme energy to do that none of you will ever know since you sit at your computer desk judgmentally.I got my six pack but still had loose skin and to hear people saying "it's your fault cause you let yourself get fat" fuck you. I grew up in it, I changed and I am much better for it. If any of you would tell me something like that IRL, I would knock you out. Misdemeanor for battery and a clean record means I'll get no jail time but a lot of community service. For punching one of you bastards in the mouth, it's way worth it.

I don't believe this sub is sexist. If you look at US census statistics, while more men are overweight(~75% vs ~66%), nearly twice as many women are grade 3 obese (BMI&gt;40; 8.5% vs 4.6%). This at least partially explains why there tends to be more content involving obese women; there are simply more subjects to choose from.
Most fatties hate non-fatties, especially the chicks. I mean after all, it's easier to be a resentful twat than it is to accept the consequences of going full whale.
But accumulating body fat and flaunting it totally is a good message! (Eats a tub of Ben &amp; Jerry's)
&gt;At Nuremberg and the war-crimes trials that followed it, for example, while quibbling about what really happened wasn’t held a crime in itself, it was specifically and rigorously prohibited to contest any such issue in mounting a defense against charges made by those tribunals, corpus delicti be damned. Defendants (they were called “accuseds,” never defendants), denied any way of ever suggesting that any alleged crime had not been committed, were limited to claiming personal noninvolvement—usually by accusing some other person(s)—or claiming extenuating circumstances to support an abject appeal for mercy from the tribunal, which ultimately passed dozens of death sentences, and even more sentences of life imprisonment. Thus did censorship of “Holocaust denial” have its beginnings.&gt;As for people who had by any chance been spared accusation, anyone who claimed enough knowledge to question the accusations faced the immediate prospect of joining the ranks of the accused on the strength of whatever involvement the claims of knowledge would necessarily be based upon. The only way out of that trap was to be documentably, unambiguously a victim of the process, and the number of victims who in any concerted way contested the tribunals’ horrific charges can be counted on the fingers of one hand.[2] Victims who might in any way fail vigorously and credibly to confirm the tribunals’ charges were in any case scrupulously deselected by the hard-working teams of prosecutors who alone had the power to call witnesses from the eager pool of would-be “victims” who by right of their selection to testify, won precious food and heated (!) shelter for the durations of the proceedings.&gt;As for any who at the present late time might wish to step forward and offer their own unvarnished, if faded, recollections of what really happened, the threat of becoming an accused (nonagenarian) is very much alive, as cases like that of John Demjanjuk demonstrate so tragically and incredibly. Thus does censorship of “Holocaust denial” live on forever in, among others, precisely the form it assumed upon the fall of the Third Reich.

Yeah, let me help you with that one... You *always* look like goddamn idiots, even before this.
My bad didn't know.
~fat~ people get sad looking at ~other~ fat people
That's true, but on the other hand say he had simply up and left after she had been on the couch for a few months or whatever. Would that be negligence on his part?
My dad is 65 with bad knees and type 1 and has never been fat. He still fits into his wedding tux. What's their excuse for calling it dadbod?
It's annoying. There's this guy I used to go to school with that occasionally pops up in the gym I go to when I'm there.. He's tall but obviously carrying way too much body fat. He's so obnoxious and loud and blows all these high numbers out of his ass claiming he can lift this or run that.. Yet when asked to prove it he changes the subject.. And/or he does improper form when trying to impress.
Glad I am not the only one who just really can't accept that word!
Oh god!!! I sat staring in horror wondering wtf was wrong with her skin in the 1st pic before realizing its panty hose (I guess?)
Fuck off randy
How was it debunked?If it's the one Im thinking of, it basically said there was a correlation of 25bmi having better health outcomes than &lt;20bmi for 60+ or something like that. I fail to see why this might be shocking..
I was laughing at the 5's myself. Even if that's a full weight bar I wouldn't be taking pictures of it.
An entirely logical conclusion too, considering how fast-paced and frantic those kitchens can get. Fatties aint got the stamina for that!
I see your point, though in this case,&gt;It's about BMI, not weight. The 180lb thing was just the average plus some more weight to avoid lawsuits.
I usually just buy granny smith apples, but then, I like sour things.
Aside from that, all of those categories count as "fit" no one searches for skinny porn, unless they're looking for very tiny women. Apparently no one searches for bbw porn either, no matter how much Dr Phil claims they do.
Eh, based on the first picture, I wouldn't call her "gorgeous." Pretty, maybe, but I wouldn't put her above a 6/10.
There's a tweeted pic of her having lunch, which looks to be at least 5-6 medium pizzas from some dominos type shit hole. Two 2l bottles of soda, one of those small dessert pizzas and other junk. It has to be at least $60 of food, for lunch.
Its buttcrack is mirroring as an upside-down "m."
Thanks, I love my lip piercing. Had it about 7-8 years now.
&gt; FrontAndCenter and BackLeft also once tried to tell me that straight white people can only get AIDS from having sex with black people.While they do sound dumb, you should acquaint yourself with AIDS infection rates among different ethnic groups.
The Facebook synopsis of the article poses it like being physically healthy AND sane is just this absurd dichotomy. Shockingly, both of those things are possible.
Reasons I HATE using OBB for anything wedding related anymore. Just a smattering of lardtards and the losers who have fetishes....oh and the ones who fake being engaged are the worst.
Lol at the internet armchair therapists. Neckbeards and legbeards all over reddit wonder why we hate their kind. It can't be because they are lazy and entitled. No, it's because we secretly hate ourselves!
That's a better way of looking at things. I like it.
&gt; Eating a ton of sugar is bad for you regardless of where it comes from. Most artificial sweeteners are **not carbohydrates**. Of course it's clear from your writing that you have no idea what a carbohydrate actually is. Nor are they "easily digestible". Most are not digestible at all by most or all people.&gt; You are so god damn stupid it actually baffles me. Nope that's you. Retard. Stop talking about things you don't even have the basic vocabulary to discuss. And learn how to do research. None of your citations are considered acceptable academic sources.&gt;Those people are fucking doctors you dipshit, experts in the field of nutrition and are educated to a level you only wish you could be on the subject.You can find quacks in any field to support anything. You know who is an official expert in nutrition (PhD and everything?) **LINDA FUCKING BACON**. Take your ketardation elsewhere.
Ah, I'll delete the comment then. I'll PM him.Edit: I'm on mobile, could you delete it for me?
Wouldn't you want your underwear on top, for restroom purposes?
Not my kind of thing, and I tend to not go looking for those sorts of things.Funny story though, first thing I found related to them (it's hard researching when you don't know what it is), was threads on /b/, so that was... interesting.
You can just see how much she wishes she could be the one on the left.
Hmm... how does a fatty's heart beat? Is it slow or rapid?
I would just give them the facts.
The jokes just write themselves
&gt; Every other day is pretty weak for working outUh....no it's not? Im in pretty damn good shape, most muscular built guy out of my group of friends (in college) and I only go every other day. Just make your time count when you're in the gym and train multiple muscle groups when you're there
You're actually right, now that I recall. I don't go very often, I used to go more as a kid but now my tiny cheapskate wife won't allow it :)
lol still doesn't work. It must be me :(
This was the incident that made me realize I shouldn't be politically correct about it. Prior to this I always treated fatties with kid gloves, but this was the straw that broke that camels back.
Who is this woman in real life? I see her on here a lot
Not needs, but wants!
I cringe every time I see or hear a fatty use the word "glomp."
I am not in the us and always thought food stamps had limitations on them. Like you can only use them in so many places and only on real food. I guess I was sadly mistaken.
ahahaha *tears*
Tank. Use a tank, then you may have a chance. Maybe.
Hams don't have genders, they reproduce by dropping off globs of fat which turn into mini hams
I didn't understand for a second, then my shitlord instincts kicked in and i laughed so hard.
That is... wow. I don't think I'll forget about reading that for a while.
God damn that was clever.
Look how anorexic and disgusting that SRS subreddit slut is in comparison to this one. They really need to check their privilege and apologise to FPH for being so triggering. It's okay though, no *real* man would ever want them.
He doesn't look like a hambeast, more husky. But the 2 litre of oj pop isn't doing anything for him. He should rethink his beverage of choice.
Removed, don't link to other parts of Reddit.
No. 9: No Description...
This submission is being removed.It is a recent repost. There are so many of these posts already, just look around and you'll find the answer.
Oh so this is what death feels like..
And still, surprisingly single...
&gt;Why do they constantly need to lean on shitToo heavy to support themselves, Too wide to not be scraping/sliding across any surface in a 10 ft. range from her center of mass.
Punishment for being a disgusting, lying creep. Though putting it on blast in public is a good option as well, putting emphasis on the lying.
Those are not feet... my god, what have we human beings done to ourselves?
Don't worry, I once tried to impress a guy by setting my hands on fire. It didn't work. I almost jumped off of a boat to impress another guy. I was to scared and backed out. I also told a guy I knew how to pick locks. I actually learned how to and then taught him. Turns out he had a girlfriend. Moral of the story- make sure they don't have SO's before you try to impress them.
I thought the part about the hormones in our environment was interesting. I guess it was acceptable in my eyes because I ran out of meds for like 3 days, but I do regret it. I do think Islam is a big problem, though. Of course I won't kill myself because an internet stranger told me so, that'd make me a dork.
It would be more productive to ask for a college-local gym discount agreement!
Wow. She definitely had to climb in through the gate to get in that position.
Please, God, let it stay in Vegas.
They seriously look like they belong to a corpse. Okay and with that thought in mind, I'm gonna go throw up my dinner now. Holy crap. Obesity. Not even once.
Because TITP movement is strong...people feel politically incorrect when they speak up. The kid had both his legs broken and a dead father. I'm way more sympathized with him than some stupid 'curvy' bitch on Tumblr claiming diets don't work so she has to keep stuffing her stupid face with lard.
I totally agree. But it's better than eating Mcdonalds or whatever shit got her to look like that in the first place. My point is, if everytime fat people tried to lose weight they were publicly photographed and shamed, they'd stay fat instead of wanting to lose weight.
But will that ruin the printing?(I've always done my laundry with cold water to preserve the shirt's colour and any printing/graphics, so it's a legitimate question.)
The pathetic thing is the communities they have the most in common with are anti-vaxxers and climate deniers. Both of those groups will ignore literal MOUNTAINS of scientific evidence against their positions, but they will pick up the one little publication that supports them kind of or even slightly and claim it makes them right. They'll ignore the fact that those papers have either been utterly discredited and withdrawn as false (in the case of anti-vaxxers) or have been paid for by fossil fuel companies and the like.
Long time shit lord first time poster, I am this yak. Fyi 5 minutes later she got off the train and the other shitlord next to me commended my handling of the situation.
Gotta be a sikkunt for flair, m8.
The first two steps
"Previous hourglass figure"She was fat before, now she's superfat
A dick is not a breakfast sausage. Nasty ass fatty.
learned? MASTERED
effyourhealthstandards should become a legal disclaimer. "I'm sorry fatty but you leg is gangrenous and there's nothing we can do about as you have legally denied any treatment by using the eyhs tag."
I'm a shitlord lol.
That is what I do not understand about these beasts. We were always outside as kids playing. NOT being outside was terrible. Rainy days or having to stay in to finish cleaning your room or help with the dishes seemed like the worst punishment in the world. Now it is prison?
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Holy crap! That should be in one of those optical illusion books.
Hmm interesting. Some fat fucks claim it's not a handicap while others do aye? I'm guess I'm guessing your in the u s a as I'm sure being huge is not a disability in Australia ( though it might be now idk) I'm sure worse people than you have done much worse things and got away with it in the u s please do a poo and wipe it in the wheel arch of there car as they will not find it for a while but it's going to be a smelly ride!
I thought this was /r/popping for second.
I knew what it was because of the Simpson's episode. I've only seen thin cartoon women do it. The real ones have all been fat.
That hail damage is irreversible.
May as well be the same thing + 'salt the earth' policy
Not to play the devil's advocate but you should totally look up prader-willi syndrome. It's cool to read about. Even in cases where you are ''genetically predisposed to gaining weight''-like those with prader-willi-the weight comes from eating too much, not the actual genetics. i don't understand the 'genetics' argument. Are people THAT stupid?
What do you mean "not the we're after here"? She is fat.Warning for fat sympathy.
&gt; We got the female star from django getting harassed for being a 'prostitute' for hanging with her husband in public... Wait, what?
I forgot about the homophobia but that's a whole other manifesto right there.
I read the post at 1am last night. Waited for the lights to go out then had a few tears.Woke up, made small talk with the shitlady, smiled and kissed her goodbye. Took the bus, train, ran up the stairs to work with two gym bags. Smiled and greeted the assistant.The whole time my head felt like it was going to explode. You know that feeling when you're holding all the emotions in? How was I going to get through the day?Opened reddit. Now having a genuine smile. Made me realize even internet strangers can impact your life.Hope your hell week is behind you, Lee!
I would have asked to be given a new table at that point. No one needs to see that while eating.
Gotta separate the wheat from the chaffs as they say.
she looks like she ate Stacy London and absorbed her appearance
Belongs in the most recent season of American Horror Story
I really don't think it is that simplistic.
Well it would help with the being scared of not knowing etiquette and knowing what they're doing part. I get really bad anxiety/panic attacks in crowded loud places. I remember when I was younger I got a membership at this new gym close to my house, but it was too much to handle because it was packed and loud as shit. Switched to one 15 minutes away with way less people and more spread out, had no issue.
Why do they keep participating in these photos? They damn well know they can't jump.
If I ask for one and they don't have them they'll laugh at me and I'll cry and pee myself though
There's totally a bike on the text that she posted about it.That's about as close to exercise that they're getting
/thread
Caledonian auxiliary, ready for duty.
That would get both. Two hamplanets one greasy fiery car wreck.
Can confirm, ex-mormon. Overdosed on 4 marijuana, still partying
Even Vvvvvvvortic.
Christ i wonder how old they are. They look old as fuck but the fats that do this type of shit are usually in their 20's...
Oh look a ~~sperm~~ whale. We all know that sack of shit ain't getting sperm.
What?! She didn't want your back to get wider? That girl was crazy lol one of my favorite parts of my boyfriends body is his narrow/small waist &amp; muscular wide back/strong shoulders/traps. What women doesn't find that attractive?! My god. Haha I would never tell him cut back on the gym! He goes daily no matter what &amp; I'm thankful for it. I only go 4-5 times a week, I wish I loved working out as much as he does, I enjoy it but I don't 'love' it like he does!
I... LOVE this photo! Check out that figure. BAM! That's hot.
I'm told that immigrating isn't all that easy to do
Shut up, hooker.
And some people think that massive blobs of fat can pass on as boobs, and worse yet, think they're attractive.
I know right. Grammar, it's a hell of a thing. I'm actually surprised someone didn't say something sooner.
Whoops, my bad. I wasn't on reddit yesterday, so I missed it. I tried to look back on the hot posts and didn't see it, but oh well. Doesn't hurt anyone to post it twice :)
God, heifer has to hate herself. Look at how goddamn taut and sexy her sister is. For me that body is perfect although I can't see her butt. Would guess it's great, and since she doesn't have perpetual swamp ass like big sis, maybe it'd be worth a lick.*That could've been you, but you chose sugar.*
That is a damn good answer. That was kind of the highlight of their civilization, right?I spent some time in Japan, but didn't get to do a whole lot of culture stuff. Mostly military stuff with some fun trips here and there.
Well said friend. For all we know that's her left boob.
Yeah. It's a choice between feeling good in a week for the rest of your life or feeling good for the next ten minutes. Hams would just rather have that 10 minute pleasure fix than a more permanent solution.
Only a true collector, i wouldnt expect you to understand&gt;tips fedora
She threw desks and chairs? Yeah right.
Wtf my leg is almost the same size of their max waist size .... does Japan even lift?
She's walking so those bites don't even count.
Goddam, this pisses me off so much. I have have no self confidence whatsoever, but do I rely on female fatties for vindication? FUCK NO.Fucking Whiteknights, NEVER GIVE THE FATS ATTENTION, IT ONLY FUELS THE DELUSION.
Nope. Med school graduate psychiatrist who subscribes to fatlogic. The worst.
I've lost at a steady rate of 10 lbs a month...and HAES is the most ridiculous, insecure, "tell me I'm pretty" bullshit movement I've ever heard of.
I completely understand. A lot of people here want more accurate numbers so that's great you can accept the fact that the original numbers were lies. That's weird you're not a "holocaust denier" for believing that but everyone else looking for historical accuracy about the holocaust is a "holocaust denier".
I have been able to a couple of times, but I'm usually a late planner so it hasn't always worked out.
Muh drankable beetus joos!
It makes sense when I explain it, but it is something unusual and unexpected. Programmers in particular have a tendency to think of themselves as the problem-solving node of the mind, and avoid a lot of the holistic approaches to existence. (I have a theory behind this - it's sympathetic nervous system activation for problem solving purposes, which turns off a lot of the "be aware of things and notice things that aren't immediately applicable to the problem at hand" processes. The sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous systems was the hint that drove me to try fasting, since digesting food is PSNS activity and programming is SNS activity.)And "maybe your problem-solving ability is affected by what you eat, when you eat it, how you sleep, and what kind of stimulation you have" is definitely a whole-body approach to living better, so it's far outside of normal programmer-type solutions.
How do people not like broccoli that is the best thing ever! In fact, I'm eating some now :)
Oh wow, I had a similar experience on monday. Dude comes in that's as big as your landwhale and sits down at the table next too me. I don't know how he didn't break the chair he was on since he could easily have fit in three.Just being so near that was almost enough to make me stop eating.
With you all the way, we shall kneel at the feet of Brodin!
That forced smile is just hilarious
just standing is exercise? lol
I dig mine, but I paid someone money to scalpel em in there.
It's true, some conditions can make it harder to lose weight. But nothing makes it *impossible*; even in death, you'll lose weight through decomposition. But just because something is hard doesn't mean you get a pass to not do it. You broke your legs? Work on your arms and your core. You have a thyroid disorder? Work out more, or eat less. You gain weight when your thyroid fucks up because you keep eating the same but your body isn't using as much (or your body uses the same but you start eating more, depending on how it's fucking up. Or both). You ate 2,000 calories (who am I kidding, probably 4,000) and your body was using 2,000, but now you're still eating 2,000 while your body only needs 1,700. So you gain weight. But cutting down to 1,700 isn't starving because it's all your body *needs* now. Jesus Christ how are these people so stupid?
I'd like to see that devil's shave chit as well.
You know what they say:"There's no i in denial"
Fuck these stupid hams.I figured this could happen, which is why I post on a separate account.
I'm sure there are worse out there, but this guy's bumshelf is like no other I've ever seen. And the way he wears his boxers OVER the fupa makes it look like he's a hula dancer!
Read this and at first thought you were a WeasleFacts bot.
goodfattylol
Thin privilege is not murdering someone while stage diving. I was a a Sage Francis show a few years ago...before he got fat. Drunk lady jumped off stage and it was like Noah parting the red sea. Plop. Music stopped. One of the best shows I've seen to date.
It's my hogbody pa, I'll put 'im down...
Thirty bananas
Bones bleed? There are blood vessels in bones? Didn't know that one....pretty cool though.
Hahahaha wow. Nothing right about that.
How fucking embarrassing. As Americans we should restrict fat people from traveling until they reach an acceptable weight. These fucking slobs are representing our country after all.
The plus sized boards on WeddingBee are my favourite place to hang out. So many hams ruining gorgeous wedding dresses. It's hilarious. And they always moan about how they can't find a store that carries their heffalump size.
I like how the ham was forced to pose with her cats because no man is interested in her fat ass...
Because it's not a "secret tip!", you can't write a whole book on "just eat less, fatass". You can write a whole book series on "Try this diet trick! Try this exotic fruit! Try this cookie diet!"
Good, because that lard-whale clearly needs to be in an entire row by itself.
Once you drink of it, you must beat the living fuck out of someone with it.
Brb, gonna hurl. :toilet: okra is.....slimy. Oof.
I agreed until the modesty thing, sort of. We should promote modesty for both sexes to encourage self respect, dignity, and not encourage one another to lust after us... But why you think this has anything to do with a bunch of poor girls getting traumatized for life by Muslim gangs I don't know, because they don't teach sensible modesty for women's own good, of course, it's all about control.But the rest gets 1000 internets.
thanks, i'll look it up. those threads are great for killing a day reading. and yeah, linking other subreddits is banned. forgot about that.
looks very unnaturalshe is also very fat
She may *want* someone fit and tall, but she probs won't *get* someone who's fit and tall
more canvas? Thats the only idea I can come up with.
Nope 5'6 108 pounds of shitlady (but I do have an inner cat lady)
It's just upsetting when you've driven a fair distance to meet up and you see the truth.
Or in the water, really. That's a lot of bulk to shift through a medium that's ~1 g/ml in density at room temp.
Hey, cows are adorable and useful. Don't insult the cows!
i'm just guessing here but i think its because of the body to brain ratio. the larger the body the more brainpower is needed to retain control over it. also not enough blood flow.
Danzig would not approve.
Even if you remove the poor part it is still slob.
She's likely not taking it off very well or just has bad skin/wrong foundation. I wear full face often and I am fine. Makeup isn't "bad" for your skin. Take it off properly at night and don't wear the wrong type for your skin and you'll be golden.
ED also frequently refers to eating disorder.
It's stomach looks sad. :(
thats not her knees bending its just her front thighs and front calves *DROWNING* her knees!How does she even have fat on the front of her calves? She's * that* fat
bullshit
Read that as santa. But thanks anyway! :-)
well i now feel like eating some blueberries..
I feel like we as men need to somehow find a way to get women to not put 90% of their attractiveness on boob size. It would go a long way toward preventing ham confidence. I've known some absolutely stunning women with smaller boobs who did not think they were attractive at all due to it.
This guy sucks. I can't wait for the one where he has a heart attack in the middle.
Dude looks just fine, until you hit the bitch-tit section.
Remember the good old days when that would have said "One size fits ALL"?
Jesus christ, what a nasty can of worms to open."That do not create a safe space to encourage participation" can be interpreted in so many ways and made to target so many subs.It will obviously be abused because of hurt feefees.
Jesus, push that whale back into the ocean before it dies!
I would rather have a million-dollar yard-sale...
Maybe she thinks she's doing up-dog? Doesn't matter; her gut's too big to do either pose. If she went to my yoga class I think there would only be two or three poses she could actually do. Mainly the breating exercises.
You weren't alone. I made a comment about covering yourself in a piece of Terry cloth and didn't get banned.
Yep, he's totally delusional. When I posted [this pic of one of my tattoos that finished healing](URL
Bahahah true! My friends and I don't wear a lot of make up. We basically just stick to powder and some mascara. Probably because we don't feel the need to wear a ton. +_+
He looks like a giant from clash of clans haha
After all, anything is cute on an attractive person. Fatties just seem to think it's the clothes that makes them cute, when it's just opposite; They make their clothes look horrible.
I've fucked a lot of tight fit pussy in my day. They are definitely not mutually exclusive.
The truck is a 1500. It is a capable truck, but not that strong. That beast will need a CDL truck to legally carry that weight. Also 1750/365=4.79. It's BJ's are worth about $5, gross.
i do too. i have a personal trainer, i told her I hated pullups. Guess what my upper body days are like now? 3 sets of 10 pullups to start, and the end of the day it's two sets of pullups til failure. She told me to suck it up and start liking them because we're going to do them a whole lot more. To her credit, they are really effective.
Yeah, he lost like 40lbs in 2 months! My bias is best bias :3
The more you know~
But if a normal person does this then it's not "confidence" it is "narcissistic" and "fat-shaming." /effyourbeautystandards
Good thing SI won't do it. They don't sell their magezine to "women's rights activists." It would only hurt their sales to give into this pressure and I'm fairly certain they know it.
Takes 7 corsets to wrap around dat ass. I'm guessing if she's using a scooter to walk, does she use one tie the corsets? How does one tie 7 corsets when your hands can only reach yo your mouth?
No support at all.
It's funny, I've never been interested in internet dating but if I ever was, I would totally try a shitlord oriented r4r. At least you know you won't get messages from someone who would suffocate you in coitus and that the people there are smart, healthy, and funny. That front page post about having a shirtlord SO made my heart ache a little. Think of how fun that would be! You could have cute shitlordy inside jokes and tell everyone that you met at McDonald's.
It fucking is a choice.Feck off, banned.
I'm sure she says the same about her obesity, no?
And I'm sweet dancing Jesus.
ankle fupa - ankupa
Damn, she hasn't had an easy time of it. That's cool she's fit enough to get out camping though! T3 is usually prescribed first, and the best thing about it is that it's easy to adjust the dosage, so really it's the safer one because you have more control over it :)
Fat fucks, went to WDW once with a severely twisted ankle, tried to rent a scooter, none were available. Spent the day hobbling around the park looking at these assholes with all the rental scooters...
Of the 23% of total Americans 45% were shown to abuse the system, such as never attempting to get a job, being totally dependent on the state and purchasing luxury items such as nice shoes and alcohol. Again I'm for the people that truly need it.
Is it really so hard for people to tell when someone's fat??
jesus
Bro I'm 6'3" and lost 40 pounds by eating 1500 calories a day. I have no idea how anyone could eat that much of their daily allowance in junk.
I remember in my Ethics class when the professor asked me to justify my decision to push the fat man, and my response was "because he's fat". He laughed because I guess he thought I was joking.
I was in an MRI for 5 hours and it was a good place to sleep
Hamplanet hits on Shitlord. Fatty gets his feels hurt and backs away when he discovers Shitlord past in FPH. OP is safe from fatty.
diagree. i think he was legit a lot lighter in the first photo. note his shoulders aren't rounded. his arm doesn't look puffy and round. i'd also say he looks heavier and heavier in each picture- despite the same myspace angle. dude got fat.
Try not to have too much fun there, buddy.
It was obvious. And it cracked me up. Have an up vote.
Who said she didn't eat it?
Is this real? This is an honest question, how do you get legs that big and out of proportion?
What show is this?
She emptied her soul to make more room for cake.
"You shouldn't eat meat. Become a vegetarian like me," said while gnawing a block of cheese.
One time I had to meet an obeast at a coffee shop for an in person consultation (office had no electricity due to a small fire). The beasts I was meeting with were SHOCKED I was only drinking a black coffee. Meanwhile their coffee had 3 shots of syrup in it plus all that heavy whipping cream on top and whole milk added to it. Made me proud to drink my plain black delicious Starfucks coffee knowing it wasn't going to make me a fucking fat ass like them!
Oh HELL to the no! I had to switch that off right after she listed the ingredients, I think I' gonna puke up some perfectly good KRATOM dammit!
Absolute degeneracy.
Girls should take this as a lesson in why they should never date fat guys ,with them you will stop carrying about what you eat and get fat .They will leave you once u get fat And you might never lose that extra weight .
The ending was what blew me away. "You're not worth the fat you're made of"
Thank you for posting this. I was taken by a similar scam a few months ago. Her photos looked good, full body pictures and all. I got verification from my friends that she looked bangable in the photos. What showed up looked at least 50 pounds heavier than her photos. What struck me most were the arms.In her photos, her wrist, forearm, and bicep were more or less the same circumference. The blob wore a tank top to the date, and there was just two giant slabs of ham looking at me. Sadly I was not a shitlord (this incident is what prompted me to join here) yet, and stayed for a while. I pondered if I was a shallow person for immediately rejecting her based on weight (Christian guilt at its finest) But then I realized - fuck that - her photos showed her several years and 50 lbs ago. I know in her mind she was thinking "they'll get to know my personality, teehee" and it won't matter. My photos are up to date, I'm being honest and it's not asking too much for dates to do the same. TLDR: former hottie gains weight, doesn't update photos, creates shitlord.
That's animal cruelty right there. Poor horse.
I wonder how he goes down on the Monster. ^Just ^super ^morbidly ^obese ^curiosity.
Please read this, you must try to stop people from giving your sister depression pills, that shit will destroy her, turn her into a drug addict(legal drug is still drug), and the nasty side effects will have long lasting consequences. If you can please try to go to a psychologist maybe or to empower her. I've seen those pills in action, this is nasty stuff, and totally wrong for a child
Ew why are they helping?
It's horrifying that a perfectly normal door and balcony would be too small for anything resembling a human.
Dude, what?As long as the user doesn't break the rules, they won't get banned. Flair just means someone's looked at your picture and verified that you aren't fat. It doesn't make you ban immune or anything.It's completely optional and the only thing it does is lend you a little bit more credibility on the sub amongst the other users and give you access to the private subs.
like uncomfortably in between, I believe and trust me I've picked a lot of feet in my glory days
My god that fucking posture. What the fuck
Did you see the recent post where they completely denied diabetes is caused by obesity? That it is mostly genetics and environmental factors? That shit is dangerous.
&gt;It just shows that we have higher priorities in life than being obsessive gym rats It literally takes no effort to not be a fatass. You have to try to be fat.
Ive gotten people say stuff about skinny abs on [me](URL
The rest is the final 15 minutes of the Blair Witch Project.
Photo of attractive, human-sized woman.. seems very triggering to fatties, of course they can't help but bring it up anytime someone is not fawning over their disgusting lard rolls, you know?
No its not me? I found it on some planets reddit account.
Nope red line. Orange line has that gross brown floor.
His breasts are huge. He needs a bra.
My question is how the fuck can they buy all that shit? I'm 23 going to school and working a full time job but I barely have enough money for my beer.
She's waaaay more than 260.
Unfortunately my lack of gallbladder demands I pay close attention to fat intake. :( I get my fat in a single serving with a multi to cover my fat-soluble vitamin needs. : (
I blame the fad diet that praised 6 meals a day. People clung to that while forgetting the part about them being smaller meals.
Dax Shepard in Idiocracy nails it by sitting in a chair that doubles as a sitter, drinking cheese (?) from a giant tub with a straw, watching "Ow My Balls!" "Go away! Baitin!"
I also got a bit depressed looking at it.
Damn. Those folks probs would not like the standard Eastern Asian, then. But I am pretty sure they fap to 2D anime pronz, anyway.
Do they think VS is pro-rape or something?
Yes. Breasts are most certainly fat spheres on your chest. Not ment for helping infants survive outside the womb till they can handle food. They serve absolutely no purpose but to be fat on your chest. /S
Ok, so now I'm being attacked as a rape survivor because finding humor in a sarcastic statement helps me in some small way come to terms with the trauma I've experienced. Fuck you. Seriously. Even if you've been through it yourself, you have no right to police what should and shouldn't offend me.
You've got this!! Download myfitnesspal and start counting calories. Well I guess you already are aware how to lose weight since you're on FPH! Haha good luck and I'm sure you'll reach your goal in no time! :)
That is a world-class FUPA. I feel like it should be bronzed.
&gt;although Pauline isn't yet confident enough to buy sexy lingerie, she drapes a nice sheet over her to achieve the same effect in the bedroom.Lost it.
Yes! I don't know why it is, but every midget I've met was super cool
Now... not to be a douchebag... but picture 1 is still on the chubby side.
This is what a fat lady with a spandex girdle looks like. So proud of her body she has to strap it down and minimize it!
I used to be BMI 25 (1,82m/83kg) ~11 years ago, now I'm BMI 22 (1,82m/73kg). Lost 10kg just using logic (eating less + eating healthier). I was studying Food Engineering and the stuff I learned was a *click* for me. I'm completely anti-"science bullshit", and that's mostly why I'm here.
And nobody can turn them down without being humiliated and boycotted, like A&amp;F.
With that bag. The horror.
The wizard of Shitlordia, sworn protector of our lands, The Penis Wizard senses a ham. With a booming voice that makes the loudest hurricane seem like the mewing of a kitten, our mighty mod appears in a moderately sized flash of light. As the disgruntled ham begins to spout the foul disease of HAES and garbage about positive reinforcement, the Shitveil crackles in pain. The Penis Wizard, attuned to the veil with his soul, also feels the pain. With eyes burning of a hatred so profound that describing it could kill the unwary reader, the purple hooded arcane master of Shitlordia begins summoning *Bannicus Fatticus: The No Coddling Cudgel*. The wizard's senses, enhanced by a mastery of the arcane that no mortal could ever hope to attain, sees through the bullshit the ham spews about not being fat. Leaping mightily into the air, the wizard first throws a spell of binding, trapping the already slowly waddling feet of the disgusting butter berserker. Roaring with the fury of a gale force wind, and unleash a spinning strike reminiscent of a tornado, The Penis Wizard lands a blow so mighty that the matriarch of hams, Tessblubber the Monstrous, staggers in agony. When the dust settles, the ham is no where to be seen, save for a steady rivulet of HAES tainted blood dripping down the wizard enchanted cudgel. With a bit of dry heaving at the disgusting site, the wizard snaps his fingers and dissipates the mess, and with a second snap, absconds back to his tower.
There's a difference, though. One is the creation of another life. The other is the destruction of life. Don't you dare group fatties into the same disgusting scene as childbirth. Childbirth can be gross looking sometimes, but not near the level of grotesque as a buttergolem.
And it still doesn't fit right
I think you're misinterpreting the numbers. In this study overweight and obese are separate categories, not obese as a subset of overweight.Edit: at least that's the way the US numbers appear.
There are so many shitlords and shitladies here overcoming real conditions, fighting through the pain and staying fit anyway. It's beautiful and inspiring, I love it.
watching her eating like that made me very very uncomfortable.But I imagine hams doing exactly that but hiding it from other people just in front of the fridge
Ice-T sure was young in that last pic.
OKC tracks how often your profile picture is clicked and by who, then matches you based on the stats that are gathered. They will claim endlessly that this is not how it works, but I actually received an email from them once explaining it when they saw I was getting clicked a lot. I'm sure there are other factors involved here, but this is the jist of what they told me directly. Also, after not using the site for a while, and then logging back in, all I saw was fatties. I complained, and they basically said I was making excuses and that their algorithm would never deliberately dump a pile of fat chicks on a user. Once I changed my profile and pic (which automatically results in OKC marketing your profile more often), my results got better. So: lack of activity + not getting clicks = fat chicks.
Where else can you find a mirror that's 8 feet wide, other than public restrooms?
Well the conversation tree goes through several people but the primary point of contention was that transgender issues are legitimate and the scientific consensus for treatment is to transition and acknowledge that individual as their recognized sex to a reasonable degree (Everyday life but not MMA for for example).That's when you jumped in claiming it WAS a disease as if I made an explicit post saying it wasn't and it had nothing to do with mental health.
How is that an insult. They're fat, he wrote down what he obviously observed of them. If you don't wanna be called fat then fucking lose the weight.
Ahh, sounds about right. He ended up gaining probably 100lbs, getting covered in shitty tattoos and dying his hair crazy colors. Do not want. Ugh.
WOOOB WOOB woob woob woob
I considered posting it there, but it seemed to be a large amount of fatlogic going into those products and their marketing. Soon to be verified non-fatty so don't worry, just need more activity of the sub...
Yeah if you didn't weren't gonna call the cops you need to get revenge. Good way is to chuck your soft drink at the freighters car, make it real sticky bonus if summer
Throw some chia seeds in your smoothie. Lots of protein :)
This guy had me in tears!
And it looks like you're a fat apologist. Take this shit back to fatlogic. Reported for stopping the hate.
It is of course quite possible I have this confused with a similar machine as well. I hop between two Planet Fitness locations and they could not be any more different. There is very little uniformity across these gyms. Luckily for me, at the times I go, both are staffed by shitlords. (Although the REALLY cool dude got canned for being too awesome. )Safe to say, I see WAY too many hammies on these with basically zero resistance at Planet Fitness. I guess that makes me a lunk....because I'm so judging when I see that shit.
I'm torn on this one, I've called out ones that attack trans* people for looking like the opposite gender, which is obviously done on purpose, rather than for being fat. As someone who has dealt with self-harm as well I see no problem making this joke, but I believe you can joke about pretty much anything.
I hate how they used the word "counterparts", as if we're similar to fatties at all.
I can't believe my eye's, that's bananas... how the hell did she even get up there so high, it would take it all day to climb those steps.
This is fucking stupid and pointless.
No sympathy for fatties allowed, only hate. Warned.
Omg that is nuts. So so sad.
Something I don't understand - why is physical beauty so important to them? Instead of forcing everyone to find their body attractive, why don't they just be like "I know it's gross but my (insert trait - e.g. compassion for others) is beautiful"? By placing importance on their fat fuck shells, they only reinforce the beauty standards they're trying to "eff". And, if it IS so important to them that their bodies be found beautiful, LOSE SOME WEIGHT, goddamn
Hearing fatlogic from people I care about or who are close to me. Realizing they are full of shit and have no desire to change their situation, only make excuses.It's the lack of motivation and rationalizations that bother me most of all.I don't hate them as people, I just can't stand listening to their self delusions.
/r/theydidthemath
I'd slap the phone out of the hand of that employee. Or just grab my shit and walk out without paying. "Oh, you were on your phone, I thought the transaction had finished."
Ooo micropenis!? Those are actually pretty interesting. I saw one once at work. You want disturbing, then look up elephantitis of the testicles. o.O omfg dude... had one patient with that and WOW. Seared into my brain forvever.
Two different kinds of killers. Gein made all sorts of morbid things; like a belt of human nipples and a lampshade of human skin, to name a couple.Dahmer was more of a cannibal. That is why your comment doesn't really work with the other poster's Gein quip.
Mackeupaddiction has a ton of hams lurking so they tend to travel in packs
Seems too young. That video is like 10 years old.
The screw was just looking for an excuse to dump this fatass on the ground
Well, I, for one, congratulate you. It astounds me that parts of Reddit are as delusional as your regular 'sneuflake'.
"I'm lazy and entitled. Everyone put me on a pedestal and call me brave"....no.
What if in 20 years this is average and she's just a time travelling online dater?
With diabetes.
Why the fuck do fat girls love to wear clothes that are way too small for them? Did they just never update their wardrobe from when they were skinnier?
We use km here but most people in the sub is as American so it was to put it in perspective.And they really "train" because even a flight of stairs kills them.
Pseudo pussy, the real pussy is hidden inside the pseudo pussy, ready to be eaten with a side of gorgonzola.
Sex is so overrated.
I think you both might want to give up on the running thing since it is destroying her knees. If she hates all other forms of cardio, maybe get her to lift? But honestly, it sounds like she's just gonna keep packing on the weight and the excuses. Also, you basically told her she's fat, so she has lost confidence being naked in front of you, and that isn't something that is easy, or maybe even possible, to fix.
Sounds like HAES followers have some extra Chromosomes.
oh absolutely! I agree.
It appears she has a 50/50 weight distribution. (shitty mspaint FTFY)[Imgur](URL
It was her project partner, then she got hungry.
My neighborhood too. Didn't notice them for a long time and suddenly they are in just about every park.I do wonder how effective they are though.
Moby Thick.
Oh please dont remind me of it. One bite of it and it was in the bin. I dont know how people eat that garbage.
photoshop + always holding her face at the same stupid angle makes the neck/chin gangbang disappear temporarily.
She might be more well-known, but at least I'll live longer.
jesus christ, I used to be 210 pounds at 6 feet and I felt like a fat fucking fuck. 300 at 5'3? Chriiiiist.
If you're taking a picture without using the mirror why the fuck are you still in the bathroom?
Banned for fat logic
&gt; I want my workout instructor to be working it harder than I am, not slowly and unsteadily. I want them to be someone I look up to!Never ever ever never never ever ever ever never ever ever NEVER take fitness instruction from someone you don't intend on looking, acting and/or feeling like in the long run. Actions will always speak louder than words!
"stop being fat" is better imo,you can eat and still go for a run unless you are a lazy fuck :o)
This is an obeast's final form.
His wife should take notes, lolLove the vibe of the video, thanks for sharing. I wonder if tumblrinas would consider this fat-shaming if the video came out now?
That's a stomach ulcer. I don't know if there's been any documented cases of Coke being the cause of one, but it certainly doesn't help and people with an ulcer already can't have acidic drinks in general.
Yep, I used to work the fuel desk at a Flying J, more than one of the disgustomers actually set their fuckin guts on the counter. I hated them SO fucking much.
I think I addressed this above, but just to be clear my use of Scripture was simply to show it was IN the Bible in some way shape or form and as such it is completely ignored by the church today. That is all :)
"Negligence corpulence". That's fucking bulltshit. Hams know that they are fat, they just don't want to do anything about it nor care. Stop giving them the benefit of the doubt. Still, always nice to see fph in the media in a some what positive light beyond what the typical SJW fucks portray it as.
Those things probably look like fruit roll ups when she takes her bra off. :/
what a self absorbed delusional cow. I cant wait till one day she has a hearattack. she is poison to young women.
this is the shit that makes me mad. I'm not good looking, so I try to be as physically fit as I can to offset that. to be pretty and let yourself get fat? what a waste.
"Swoleppelle Show""Swoleppelle Show""Better not bring yo' kids!"
Fuck off. In 15 or so years, there's going to be an anti-fat revolution just like anti-smoking. Fuck you and your fatass.
If it's any consolation, you have a wonderful narrative style.
I will defend Starbucks to the end, but I won't defend that. That's absoultly disgusting.
Dude, if you've ever played the game and paid attention, they're all shitlords, it seems. It's awesome.
So many zits. Yuck.
I'm always amused to see this magazine in particular. They feature both a weekly crash diet craze and high sugar/fat/calorie desserts on the cover of every issue.
Probably dresses would be okay lumpwise. They might not sit well in the waist/hip region, depending, but as long as your lump doesn't mind a bit of dangle there isn't much in a dress which is liable to constrict.I'm not sure how yoga pants are gonna work, though.
&gt; With fatties you get your dick greasy because you'll probably end up sticking it in the wrong fold thats all sweaty and greasy. It comes out covered in a film of gunt cheese. Maybe you'll even find the remnants of a hamburger down there from one of her earlier meals.URL
Whatever it is, it's disturbing lol. He actually has a set of tits. Delusional
Looks like a fatter version of Red from OITNB... I'mma go with female
Sorry, I can't get past her horrible top CLAW HAND to see the rest of the atrocity
I had an uncle like that with that mentality. Unfortunately what changed his pov is he suffered a stroke (he is pretty tall 6'2" roughly 280 lbs) when he had the stroke. He came to me for help I told him to change his diet. With just eating right he dropped 40 lbs in 6 months, he added cardio dropped another 40 by December. He tells me he is ready to lift weights so I hope he builds some solid muscle.That mentality can only be changed with a serious event like my uncle had
I'm a very small woman, and I had to use the large one size fits all gown. It was dragging the whole time :weary_face:
Das discriminayshun. Dey should make closets for real bogeyits.

Ur trying to b all a lion staking it's pray but I c throu ur shity excuses. Ur fat or a fat lover or sum shit. Btw plenty of fat men on this sub if u look for like a minute on other pages. R u high mate?
Ah yes, the glorious repost. Don't forget to post it again next week, too, OP............ .... ........
Fat does not mean strong.
I'd waddle my fat ass far out into the forest where I would be unlikely to be found and just do myself in. I just would not live like that.
Could you provide us with a weight loss picture of some kind? I would be curious to see what he looks like now.
What is it?
Damn bro, everytime I see you pop up you are getting down voted to oblivion lol.
I've seen quite a few lardbeast mennonites, surprisingly.
Oh my fucking god! The arm! Is it getting bigger or what?
Oh fuck off you little shit.
"Scooter slugs"...love it!!I hope you won't be offended if I use that one!
Haha prick!
She's 44. Holy-Shit.
Just watching sports makes them work up a sweat, so you can bet your ass they count that.
Good point, and makes me think that a Fight Club for women might not be a great idea. Still I think with a good writer and a message of it's own it might be cool.
My guess he's slightly more obnoxious than you. He's a huge planet, you are a smaller one- but a planet nonetheless. You have a fat face and fat upper body. U iz a fat fuck ...sorry, but it's true.
This is as disturbing as fat people.
This same attention hog was also [on 'My Strange Addiction'](URL
Be active, get a sharpie and clean yourself really well, then read the sidebar.
Like a 400-pound bullfrog...
&gt;This girl is 18 years old and I also share a history class with her where she and her chubby friend thought that Americans were trying to be "as nice as they possibly could" to the Native Americans by forcing them all onto shitty reservations on the worst land available.I guess that was as "nice" as they could be without just resorting to more wholesale extermination. I feel bad for you to have to sit through that kind of stupid with her. It'd be kind of funny if it didn't make you want to weep for the future.
Larger women must accept that their existence is shaming slimmer women. By being large you are harming others.SlimAcceptance#Feminism
Some material can only be stretched so far
Thanks I will look up those lifting things you sent. I mean I consider myself more out of shape than fat. Because I look scrawny. But we can all always improve!
As the Redeemer of Fat continues speaking the foul tongue of fat sympathy, the air begins to bubble and distort at the utterance of tainted lies. The mods sense a disturbance in the shitveil, the thin mystical line holding the Clan of Beetus at bay. At each echo of false claims of fat beauty, the veil sizzles and you sense it growing weaker. The mods have witnessed the damage, and come flowing out in majestic splendor. With battle cries of warnings and the swoosh of ban hammers filling the air, the Sympathizer of Fat's words fall short. *enter battle sequence*
OP I'm sure you're not fat but just as a head's up, the combination of close up &amp; downward angle of your photo is what a lot of catfishing fats use to mask their obesity.
It's to stop cows escaping from the farm, like actual real cows, not fat people
Thanks man
One of my favourite things about obesity is that even when the fatty does muster enough willpower to eat like a human for a while, they'll be forever scarred by their past inaction.
I need to come up with something like that for my ugly Supra.
Guess makes some clothes that aren't too flashy. Very appealing button ups that look good on just about anyone who is in shape.
I will add an essay of hers about it in an upcoming album.
[Shion from no.6](URL
She likes swimming. She's also ready to test for her black belt. Having a long reach helps a lot there.
I dont know what to think about it. In one hand its disgusting but in the other... if i was only fit man in my "dadbody" infested country, that would be glorious.
He lives in a desert. Not a food desert, but a real desert.
Hope she meets a guy pretending to be midget to prove how shallow fatties are.
Oh for fuck's sake!
My man crush!
It is hard to tell from just one picture, but number 4 might be within normal BMI range.
Unless you do crazy shit in the squat rack. What is up with that nonsense?
Your statement really breaks my heart. I mean, listen to yourself.
Meta-fupa.Yo dawg.
The words of shaming burn and sizzle the sympathizer, leaving trails of hate fire scars upon his flesh. As he jerks and spasms under the agonizing chastising, Achtung_Shitlord's pure voice booms around, shaking the bones of the warned one, and bringing him to shame. As this was a first offense, the ban hammer is left hanging at his side.
Pro shitlording there m8.And your eyebrows aren't tacky so much as... unique.
I once had a doctor who also ran a foundation to educate and treat for diabetes. In his office were all manner of materials regarding the effects of excess weight. The one that stuck with me most was the poster that illustrated how each pound on your skeletal frame is roughly 3 extra lbs of pressure on your spine, 6 on your knees, and 9 on your ankles. His whole family and all of his staff were very fit and in great shape.

I have MFP, I find using it to be a pain. I just mentally add it up (roughly) and just go from there. I'll be walking here soon once the weather breaks too. Thank you!
Yeah she has. But she isn't fat like this ugly hippo
She's right. Her metabolism is different: it's higher. Stupid fattie.
If that's only 1 verse it's gonna be a long ass song.
&gt; I wasn't the one going apeshit over what food someone chooses to eat. neither was I. I very much enjoyed researching and going through your arguments. I just enjoyed this chance to talk with someone.
Geez, that was a fast fall, that thing built up some speed FAST. love it hahaha
Trust me... There's a lot of heavy breathing

They had Test to get through their workouts!Well water intoxication is a thing especially for athletes, the funny thing though is most sodas have rather low relative LD50.TL;DR: Your chance for intoxication is higher with Cola than water.
Yea and we need a movement to prevent obesity becoming a legal disability.
You know these things?
He dun look fat .Edit - I mean , kids like that are generally under 100lbs . You're telling me this kid weighs 150lbs ? Or anywhere near that ? Pls

How many calories does creating an alt account burn? I'm trying to ballpark how many she spent just to whine in that thread (the unusual amount of physical effort for that blob might be making it madder).
That's great. Just remember that you do actually have to eat more to build muscle. I'd recommend tracking your calories with MyFitnessPal. You can access it from your web browser or download the app on your phone. Underweight people have a tendency to over-estimate their consumption and struggle to gain mass, especially when they increase their TDEE by weightlifting. Compound lifts are probably the best thing a newbie can do, but they're by no means the only way to get strong or big. We have subreddits for virtually every kind of fitness there is, and if weights don't turn out to be your thing, there's always /r/bodyweightfitness.I'm sure your friend's uncle knows what he's doing, but it never hurts to get the same info twice.
Every shitlords' nightmare.
of course they'd use a babe for the pic
GROUPONWhere?GROUPONWhat?GROUPON!Sorry, this sounds made up.GROUPON?If only this were real.GROUPONOh well.
The fat acceptance movement is trying to redefine what is considered attractive. They are trying to make society embrace their fatness as a normal thing. They can't achieve those goals with groups like /r/fatpeoplehate getting the truth out. In under a year FPH got to 150,000 subscribers: that's a lot of truth getting out. Truth is dangerous to the fat acceptance movement so they fight it at every turn.
Does it still count as wiggling your butt if your butt is just part of one continuous pile of fat?
You know, when you go through clothes racks, looking for your size, you come in contact with various sizes, including sizes for fatties? One day, I realized that as I go through those clothes, I might have touched something that fat people have tried on and decided not to buy. Like their bodies came in contact with those fabrics, and I might have touched that fabrics.And people wonder why I always keep sanitizer on me when I shop.
Haha thanks
Out of curiosity, is it okay to just take a picture? I was on holiday last summer and walked past a gorgeous Aston Martin and definitely took a picture. I wasn't in it [the picture], nor did I touch it.
Yeah just started my cut want to make sure I don't drop weight too fast, thanks mate.

Sugar doesn't make you fat either, in moderation. Diet pop is fucking disgusting in my opinion, and I don't want to be penalized for getting headaches when I drink sugar substitutes.
Yeah i'll start doing that! They don't deserve my niceness!

&gt;bisexual means that you could be perfectly happy if you never had sex with a man again. I don't think you know what bisexual actually means.I've known a couple bisexual people who would be quite upset if they were told they could never have sex with the opposite gender ever again. And I bet there are plenty more.

They aren't addicts. They're fat pieces of shit with no self respect or self control. Food doesn't have mind altering, intoxicating effects. Normal people can consume food every day and not be "addicted."
Haha no, I compete in Muay Thai but that would be a funnier story.
Warning for fat sympathy.Also protip: Saying please don't ban me doesn't work.
Personally I'm not sexist at all, I'm just here for the occasional porn. I'm sure that some people here actually believe all that though. I don't think you should let your sexual fetishes bother you. There's a huge difference between being sexually degraded by a significant other for your own enjoyment than actually believing that you're inferior in some way.
She's been bulking... for decades.
BUT She looks ASIAN! . I thought they had Skinny Genetics!? How can she be Fat???? /s
LOL tfw you try to religion and get out-religioned completely invalidating your point. BACK TO THE HUGBOX!
Gives the phrase "lipstick on a pig" a new meaning. Kind of offensive to pigs though.
WOW, I feel sad for her. Her hand still on the chips and looking for clothes.
How could you leave off gluttony? AKA the one that every single fat person falls under.
She does have a point: Stop hating your body, you stupid lazy cow. Start treating it with respect, eat healthy ,exercise . What she is doing right now is disrespectful and stupid.
LOL! I was really off; thanks for the translation.
How many layers of spanx do you think she's wearing in this vid? Heh
After their 30 year long dirty bulk of course
How about making a clause that the amount of money spent on food for personal consumption can only be X times more expensive than their gym membership in a certain span of time? That is strictly a monetary amount multiplied by a factor of another monetary amount. I'm going to try my hardest for that clause if I am ever in the mood to get married, which I don't think I will ever be. Then again I am only 24.
Bout tree fiddy.
Large eyebrows make their huge faces look more proportional, and high arched eyebrows make round faces look longer. The crazy brows are supposed to make their faces look normal. Of course, they could just eat less and their faces would actually BE normal.

Errr i hope your 4000 calories is mainly protein based as just 4k will do you no favours at all.E.g 4000 calories of just potato chips will not gain you any muscle at all.

I can see why these fatties wear sandals all the time, now.
It's like they're a first time skier when it comes to standing up.
&gt;so it's hard to tell where the holes wereIf the roof had completely disintegrated then this might be a reasonable response. Presumably you've at least seen videos of what the demolished Krema II Leichenkeller 1 looks like?&gt;somebody at NASAHmm. [By which I mean, if you find someone who is offended by "holocaust denial" and entirely closed to the possibility that gassings did *not* occur there -- not too difficult, especially within certain demographics -- their "analysis" will obviously be supportive of the extermination narrative.]&gt;The people introducing the pellets were supposed to have worn gas masks so I don't see why this would be a problem.The problem -- and one of the reasons why the removal of the outgassing Z-B has become an issue -- is that the "witnesses" to the gassings reported a much shorter time for gassing + ventilation (at least, in those "gas chambers" with ventilation) than the entire outgassing cycle of Zyklon-B, which (depending on temperature) is about 2 to 2.5hrs.In other words, the Zyklon-B would need to be removed from the "gas chambers" before the room is ventilated, [and the door opened,] and people move in to clear bodies -- lest the entire building become flooded with cyanide gas, and the Sonderkommando working in the room, and loading the ovens, become inconveniently and accidentally dead before their supposed 4 month life expectancy (which the most famous SK managed to dodge multiple times!)If it was removed from Krema II, using these wire mesh push-in devices, what was done with it? If it was removed from Krema III, how was this done, etc?
Indeed. Most pot smokers I know are normal people. Would never have known they blazit if they didn't tell me directly.
Hey mods, when I heard of Reddit's new policy on sexual unauthorized images, I immediately thought of this place. Couldn't this sort of things be exactly what the fatfucks could use to cause this place problems? Fuck I hate that they'll take every possible inch to stay in their diabetes filled bubbles and make everyone give concessions to their entitled fat fucking faces.
See guys pluto is a planet.
Most of her background sounds like lies, but the pictures they're saying are her dont really look like her. I'd believe she was 36 though.
There is literally no definition to that ass, it's just a continuation of her fat as fuck thighs.
Yeah, she is pretty cute. But it also seems fatties are increasing shitlords worth.
Wow
I thought inhaling the smoke was a harmful part of it. Shit, campfires supposedly damage your lungs.
As someone working for the gym-built body, it's refreshing that people do still find lady muscles attractive :)
Dafuq happened to that nipple? And why is it leaking?Is he/she lactating??
Oh geez, I actually laughed out loud at this. A six inch is barely a snack to the average obeast. Pro tip though, don't know if it's location specific, but you can order the inch ones.
I'd like to see a sort of weight tax/fee per person if they're doing weight fees on luggage.
She means that she loves it when men consent.But that won't stop her if they don't.
But, that would make **them** bullies instead of the bullied! Are you implying that they were lying and/or delusion about their special snowflake victim status this whole time??I need a plate of cookies, my sugar is so low from this shock.
Beg your pardon?
Looks like someone already punched him for being a porca.
Yuck
Coca cola life? In the green box?
It's a Fat-spiracy!
I bet those ham planets will say "I just can't lose weight! When I go to the grocery store I spend almost all of my time in the veggie aisle! Must be genetics"
Welcome to the sub, shitlord.
i actually know a person who is a fat fuck, and admits that she pretends to be pregnant. she will rub her disgusting flabby tummy in front of people and ask for seats.
**Context:** They picked up these habits 8 weeks ago. 9 weeks ago they were 500lbs each. They are too stupid to realise this means anything.
[Him](URL
There should just be a fat tax, reparations paid to those who stay fit for having to live on the same planet as those who don't.
Jesus fuck. When I worked at Wal-Mart this happened all the time almost like clockwork around EBT time. By the time I left, they had installed a kickstand on the front to keep the toilet from breaking off the wall.
I think the real sign says "Kernow, a'gas dynergh" im not sure what that means thoughedit: a duh. it means "welcome to Cornwall", in cornish!
It's funny because as a female I actually prefer the waist measurement, not the size 8 in one store that *is* a size 8, and in the next store is a size 4, next store a size 12. If we used waist measurements it would make shopping so much easier!!
&gt; I'll be reporting you for intellectual theft ... which is a pretty big dealThere has never been an emptier threat.
Don't have sex, because you will get pregnant and die! Don't have sex in the missionary position, don't have sex standing up, just don't do it, OK, promise? OK, now everybody take some rubbers.
Then I better not become a politician...
Man this poor girl. Who knows what kind of difficult life she's had. You guys are horrible.
As many fitness models as I follow on Instagram, I don't feel like I internalize them as much as I did as a young girl. There's just a point of maturity I reached where I'm not comparing myself or trying to reach unobtainable goals. I look at them like "oh she looks really sexy and fit, I wonder what I would look like if I lost more weight."
I'm surprised about the takeout as well! For all people say it's cheaper, I definitely could not eat out 3 times a day + snacks, I could never afford it! What confuses me the most, either when I see the obeasts in real life or in documentaries, is how they afford the sheer volume of food. It's mind boggling, especially when they're immobile and on disability. Maybe it's different in the states, but up north I'd be hard pressed to find cheap fast food 3-4-5-12 times a day.
I just get extremely angry when I see these Hamplanets bragging about how good they look and how clothes don't fit them in the right areas... It's because you're fucking ***FAT***. NOT chubby, NOT husky, but FAT. Clothes don't fit you because people aren't supposed to be like that. They have a problem and it's worse than anything else you can do to yourself )I.e. Smoking, drinking, gambling). /rant
It seems positive? I'd need the full article but it sounds like they're encouraging more actual humans to join us here
Is this a TV show? Are they displaying fatties for out fat shaming entertainment?
"I'm a pacifist."Uh. Right.
I'm sorry about your kitty. :'(
I love the gap trigger one and need it ! In an extra small please ^^
She has a Master's Degree in Journalism and is an editorial assistant in another respected paper (all from info she has put in the public domain). Her blog is horrendous.
I dont get these hammies. I am a US size 7(sometimes 5) and even I feel uncomfortable in a bikini. I understand you feel confident about the shitty way you look, but why would you willingly go out in something you know people are going to mock you for?
She reminds me of a Miltank. :(
I strongly suggest using an alt. Folks are getting shadow banned left and right for posting here, even once or rarely.
&gt; statistically no obesity in Africa. You need to [review that assumption](URL
How delusional do you have to be to think you look good and should post this photo online? Or to even take the photo in the first place?
She's obviously delusional and pissed off as all hell, serves her rigt fat cow.
It's a more intense version of "Guess the gender" called "moobs or boobs?"
Also a girl, also have twin brother. Will you pm me, too? I don't mind a copy-pasta and maybe I can help. *Hugs.*
[A wild picture appears!](URLAWWWW YEAH, bean sprouts are fantastic. Only downside to them is that they last very little on the fridge, but totally worth it.
It's a good day to be a scale manufacturer :-)
The worst part of a fat barber is when they lean over you and press their McDonald's supersized belly into your shoulder.
mmm..bacon..doh!
"Oh god I'm not clicking that imgur" Did he send her a picture of his fat-enveloped dick?
If it weren't for the bellybutton I'd just assume it was her rear. Oh dear.
He was with her...you can't tell..but she's well past her prime..she was probably in her 40s.
Yes and yes. A good friend of mine is jacked (and a lurker here on FPH, so Hiiiiii C!!!) and he was much smaller and skinnier a few years ago. He is jacked because he works his ass off. It doesn't come naturally for *anyone*.
Oh, thanks! I didn't see the red lines between the original leg and the copy!
How to be literally Hitler - Insert this image half way down into a friend's spank bank folder.
One of my favorite subs! I haven't posted recently (I got a puppy a few months ago, busy) but life is getting back to normal so I can post cute photos again :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:
My thighs touch, but I've never gotten chafing, including when running marathons. If this is happening to you whilst moving around your house or an office instead of just super strenuous exercise, something is not right. Edited for words
My travels through this album:OK, pretty eyes. I'm into it. Cute smile, very nice. She's got some booty, but is that a love handle? Alright, what the fuck?! Bitch, why would you hide 100 lbs of fucking fat from me?!
Not even a mile. 19 minutes.Waa waa waaaaaaa.
When something has that many folds there is always atleast 2 or 3 gauranteed wet spots...
"How many moons do you have in orbit" lol
Why do they even attempt...?
Of course!
I love the way he talks.[Idlisumeatonlotion...therewego..](URL
The buttered biscuit on the ground has a cankle brace on her foot. "Mah joints."
I'd love to mod if you're still looking.
At least he's fucking trying you dicks
Love the self timer remote she's got. I think that makes the whole situation worse.. like, if she was being photographed by a (fucked up) cohort, then that's one thing. But she got out of bed, and thought "*Hey I've got a great idea*", and then went and did this on her own. Get a fucking JOB, or SANITY, or SOMETHING. JAYSUS.
And why do fat people have to come here to try to shame us out of shitlording? The hypocrites do absolutely everything that we do, just with the opposite goal. They claim we shame them by telling them no thanks when they want to date us, but have no problem turning away someone who doesn't fit their standards, and insist it's not shame, just that they have standards. I'm getting sick of this shit.
He better run, ones horny but the other is hungry.
I took the course with a friend who has done competitive swimming all his life. You can imagine the body fat percentage on this guy. He's able to launch himself up and out of the way with just his upper body and land crouched with two feet on the deck.
That much weight concentrated into one area could put the earth mantle out of balance sending us either hurtling into the sun, or into a new ice age.
I'm so lucky. I showed my mom this sub a couple weeks ago and she made me bookmark it for her.
I like big boobs, I like little boobs and I like women without front butts. Boobs
Starting wage, its in pounds. ($26.5k). Also the UK's national healthcare compared to the US's had some control on wages of nurses.
I once told a bunch of Internet fatties that being fat can't be healthy. That caused a shit storm in which they came to a conclusion that I was once rejected by a fat woman and that's why I hate them. [Mrw I'm a straight woman.](URL
I always look for water. Nope. Just milkshakes with whipcream. "hold the cherry on top, I don't eat fruit"

And that's only into the belly button canal!
Everybody dies, healthy folks just spend more time on death row.
The one on the right looks like her mom. Fat ages you as much as smoking.
I use Aviary photo editing app.
Thanks for saving me some time... You pretty much summed it up.Eating at BK while in Barcelona, and it is the highlight of the trip, apparently?!?!?! WTF?
I certainly wouldn't want to get kissed by her.
Aside from her being gross...that has to be the ugliest bathing suit top Iv ever seen.
Because buildings represent thousands of years of human innovation and architectural development.Hams just represent years of poor decisions and crippling cognitive dissonance. They also destroy the parts of buildings which were built for shitlords, i.e. toilets, doorframes (!), floors, chairs.
I wish this was in capitals. With a "BITCH" thrown in at the end. Missed opportunity :(
Eat something so I don't feel bad about being a disgusting fat whale! Muh feels!
Actually hate speech is NOT illegal in the United States. We do still have a First Ammendment and shitty speech is as protected as any other kind. In fact, for speech to be free, that which you do not approve of must be protected.URL
There are people in my city who have small cranes installed in the back of their pickup trucks. These cranes are used to lift and lower those supersize scooters into the back. Most of the time, those scooters are not for normal-sized disabled or elderly people. Land whales on wheels.
Yeah, and that's with all that thigh and belly fat limiting her ROM to make it seem like she's kinda doing a real squat.
I put the conversation back up. I definitely rustled some jimmies.
So low-levelled stripping is a talent now?
like damn i knew some models fib a little and give or take one or two inches, but a whole 60+ lbs?
If we got hazard pay for working with the morbidly obese the healthcare system would go bankrupt(er). My issue isn't the patients directly. If I were intolerant of them I wouldn't last long in medicine. My issue is that the effects of their obesity make for potentially hazardous work environments.
Cheese trash LOL made me laugh too hard
That's one way to lose weight.
Damn she hid a good 100lbs with those angles, thank god she added one full body shot to warn people.
Reminds me of those things that pushes play-doh through a shape.
Express does the same thing actually. I thought maybe I was just tripping. Ive bought pants from there that fit perfectly fine, then got another fit jean, same brand, same day, that were so loose around the waist I couldn't wear them without wearing a belt and putting on gym shorts underneath.
Are you talking about your PR? My best is 19 :06 but I wasnt wearing spikes and my coach said I could've ran sub 18: 45 (he wasnt pissed, just dissapointed). This was in september though so I could definitely go faster now. Last wednesday I PRed my mile at 5 :16, I'm very happy with that : ) running is so hard but SOOO rewardingTLDR - I love running. My best mile is 5 :16 (ran last wednesday) and my best 5K is 19: 06 (ran in flats in september)
That's slower than a beetus cart
The look of determination on his face always had me wishin this was a candid photo.

This is one of the things that pisses me off the most. We shouldn't stereotype fat people, but since I'm not fat, we can conclude:I'm bitchy.I have a mean, unkind personality. I have no idea what's like to be made fun of or ridiculed, so I have no problems doing it to others.Nice. Yeah, that's fair. Great.
You're on the wrong subreddit.
Breakfast of champions!
Of the people who are overweight to super morbidly obese, a small percentage have actual legitimate medical conditions that is a direct cause of their weight. However, I still firmly believe that they can mitigate it and even off-set it with proper eating habits and exercise. That's just my opinion.
She spelled manatee wrong.
There's plenty of dating sites where only fit people are allowed to post profiles. Use one of those instead! Then you won't have to worry about the herd of butterhuffers bothering you.
9 hours a week is about 1.3 hours a day.Better than some, but hardly "busting your ass" (assuming that number is even close to being true).
I fucking hate how fat people always type the word love in capitals. It shits me to tears nearly as much as looking at their disgusting mugs.
hairloss this early in life? ouch..
How is you mentioning CP relevant to gore being posted? I don't get it. And it not being illegal.
SO. MUCH. BUTTHURT.
Fat. Pink. Mast.There, I said it.
I´m fat and happy so it´s not my problem if others don´t like it.Fat people always try and sit down on public transport which means that the person sitting next to them is fucked. We´re going to have to pay for your healthcare bitch.You´re nasty to look at and should be banned from the beach.
&gt;I feel like I would've been smacked around with, "Why are you trying to change her? SHE IS PERFECT!"Naw. They'll say something like "help her, be sensible, don't bully her, it's difficult for her" etc.You can hate her choices without hating her as a person, I think. If you try really really really hard.
There was one smoking in the underground bus station thing today, whilst perched upon his scooter thing. The one time there's no security around...
Do you know this chick? If so, shame her back into her previous iteration. She looks like one of those people who will take great offense to insult about her weight. It's better to save her now than wait for her to balloon up to deathfat size.
I flat out asked my shitlord boyfriend this weekend to sit me down and talk to me if he ever noticed me gaining weight. I have the same request if he notices me losing weight, too, as I have a history with anorexia and am apt to fall back into old habits when life gets stressful. I need to know these things regardless of how they might make me feel because I believe it is a sign of true care and compassion when you let someone know they're becoming unhealthy. It says more than just "I love you"; it says "I love you so much I want you around for as long as humanly possible." And I think that's pretty neat.
Evident jowls in the left picture, too. I think she always does that "o" shape with her mouth to try to stretch out the jowls a little.
Former fatty chiming in: the stomach gets flatter when you lay like that, her body is making a concave shape (like a u) and it hides her stomach. She may not be super fat, but the line on the stomach, raised ribs (notice you can't see any mark of her ribs until the stomach, where she's sucking in) and distinct lack of collar bones give it away.
That's what you're here for.
She looks what I imagined Doris Umbridge when I was younger.
Well they already limit height to 6'4", because they want people to fit in the spacecraft. A hamplanet wouldn't even be able to squeeze through the hatch.
I thought the older woman had her hand down the other woman's pants until I looked closer o.O
This is a former fat person who was definitely bullied for being fat, hence why he is accusing us of being bullies.Give him some time, usually these types turn into the best shitlords.
Absolutely disgusting
hey whats wrong with Idaho.... I like it here... north Idaho is best Idaho.
I see your point and I totally agree. It's just that on most scales I've seen it seems that she is only overweight. Still, it does affect her mobility in the ways you describe. She doesn't get enough fiber for sure, but I'm not about to tell her to eat more of anything right now lol
Looking at her second last picture, i assume chronic pain in her knees,probably too much gunetics...
Thinking about it, I quite like Magda. It sounds continental.
Not before they destroy the healthcare system with their medical problems
Check out her currrrrves! And her bumps!!
Maybe lose some weight to stop the hate, fucking heifer.
She has huge everything.
The nose comparison is rather enlightening as well.
I thought their glasses looked similar.
No idea. As of the last update from the old one, she said that the fat one was being moved to a nursing home and out of the ICU. She's off life support, but has a tracheotomy tube.All this is from pneumonia, by the way. Which is directly related to her being 700 pounds.And this is after their mother had a stroke from being like 450, and they "stay home to take care of her."You'd think that your mother having a stroke from being fat and your sister being in the ICU unable to breathe on her own from being fat that you'd *get on a fucking diet.* But, no. She keeps reviewing ice cream and candy.
When they see a stoner, they think "man, that guy should stop smoking so much weed"They see a homeless person on the street they think "That guy should clean up and get a job"They see a junkie on the road, they say "He should go to rehab"They see a fattie on the street they say "SHE IS BEAUTIFUL AND SHOULD NEVER CHANGE".It's a fucking illness. They should be sent to rehab for being so disgusting. Not coddled and rewarded.
Thanks. You must be sooooo cool to not be able to spell 'conditions' properly.
Flies love shit. I'm sure they'll be fine.Unless she sits down...
Lol I like the point you made, but Orwell was referring to London In 1984. It's highly unlikely that it could play out here in the U.S. Huxley better describes modern day America in his book- a brave new world. If you thought 1984 was scary wait until you read a brave new world, it's a much more likely scenario.
Those cellulite dimples are making me question reality
There is beautiful irony in her choices.
Are swollbro?If not, fuck off.
Fuck being politically correct. If you want to be a spineless pussy fine. But I refuse to be 'politically correct' It gets to the point that we can't even have an opinion. Who ever came up with being politically correct was an idiot.
That's weird. I'm a trail runner and I can do 30 some push ups and 17 pull ups.
The demo loop in the store is the closest this ham will ever get to burning calories from a run.
Props to her ankles for lasting this long
This is true. We also have visible veins.I can donate blood and save people but you can't.That means if someone you loved needed blood, someone else would need to save them because you are too fat and incapable of doing it yourself. And I'm happy to be that person.
Lol, no. I have been fat shamming her since she got married the first time. I even gave her a Fitbit and told her that the average is 10,000 a day.
I'm seeing this all over the place at the moment. It's "edition" not "addition".
The muffin top of the one who is smaller, and her visible gut punching over the elastic waist of her shorts. Maybe if you like chubbies, she is clearly over acceptable bmi. A lot of shitlords start seeing so many fats they think others are "thin" or "hot" by comparison. Cover up the ham with your hand and then look at the other. Both are big, one is still a baby whale.
Lies all of it. If it was 30 pound she'd be dead. The only way something would get that big would be something with cancer. There was a lady on house with a stomach tumor that made her look pregnant, but that's TV and I don't know if that's possible.
Competitive eating?
&gt; just stop eating so much shit and exercise a little and, miracle of miracles, you won't be as fat.Most hamplanets who attempt this admit defeat when they haven't lost their weight within a weeks time.It's a lifestyle change, not a temporary one!
I get the feeling this fatty verbally abused the poor guy and was demanding a "better" form of transport until he sighed and said that. Alternatively, he might've been trying to make a joke and she got butthurt and fabricated the tone of disgust.
&gt; training as a massage therapist"So, here's Jabba, your therapist. She will take care of you today. She won't use oil, she has greasy hands already, this will do." I'd rather have my back stay broken in three parts than let a 200 pounds beast get near me.
Like srsly if you use MFP or something its only like 2 minutes total out of your whole day.....if anything, quickly logging what you eat can help you think LESS about food because then you KNOW whether or not you're overeating instead of just worrying about it! :O
Mississippi leading the charge
This isn't obesepeoplehate or /r/we-only-hate-fat-people-if-they-store-it-in-odd-places. Come on.
I have small tits, don't even know what size bra I would wear because I either don't wear one at all or just wear thin sports bra things. I would much, much rather have my perky small boobs than big sacks of fat, and I know my bf feels the same. How sad is your life when the only thing to be proud of is how fat your tits got? Ew

Didn't this creature die?
Downhill both ways!
I like how OP used "they're" in the title. Because he doesn't know what this blob is either.
It's an everything you could really ever want store plus samples.
My first squad leader when I got into the Army was fat. He was the "oh yeah I was gonna go to Ranger School but..." kind of guy. You know the type.
We should upload pics of us, who are thin, but not posed/no makeup on, etc to effyourbeautystandards and see how well that goes.
The last pic, there you can see how they are not humans anymore. Should be pretty obvious that fat isnt healthy when you need help breathing. But fatties wont understand that.Existing like that is an insult to life, and should not be allowed. Fucking disgusting disgrace of lard eating shit.
And hereWeGo
Oh man. That one brightened up my day.
They have apps for that now? Dayum technology, you scary.That 3rd pic though - most blatant neck shooping I've ever seen lmao
I love going to the park with my boy. If there are any hams (and there usually are) who are too fat to play with their kids, I like to conspicuously do a bunch of pullups while climbing around with the boy, and just generally indulge in athletic behaviour.
Wait....There's a game? I'm gonna have to check that out when I get home....

I think being gay is a choice.

I know he can't drink water because he said it "burns up" his throat. That's the wording be used. I googled it and read that for some people it can blister their throat, but I don't know for sure if it does that for him
I do agree with your comment. However the reason this progress pic and others like it annoy me is that there is a barely noticeable amount of progress. If you truly care about getting in shape just fucking do it. If you must post pictures on social media so you can have your ego massaged, do it then. I think hams that post their "progress" too soon get a false sense of achievement from people telling them they're skinny now and they look great. Telling people about your goals is a bad idea in general, studies show that you are more likely to fail than if you just go ahead and achieve your goals in secret.
Well no. Ill be up to 14lb heavier at the end of a bilk cycle, but still look fit rather than fat and cellulite ridden. She doesn't look like she's even trained with weights, which is the entire purpose. You cut to reveal the muscle.
Awwww it's the 240 pound plus size model everyone is talking about!!!! How beetusful
She's disgusting and I hate her.
&gt; but great opportunity for content hereVery true. Their forms are all off. Should take a video one day.
Shut up Greg, for the love of god.
I'm sure she does if she walks around campus. I'm on one of the sports teams too and see it allllll the time. So sickening.
Nah yo a real man has pecs his girl can rest her head on
There's a lot of genetics and conditions on that table.
At least she's doing something.
Big hips, aka spare tire.

"I googled John Hopkins and he's like so old he clearly doesn't understand new science"
Her makeup is using the patriarchy's own weapons against them!!!
Nope, just Russian history.
Or tatoos?
I'm willing to bet she does eat vegetables all the time. All damn day.
Totally not the socially acceptable response i was expecting.
She could simply wear a raft?
You can use them as meat shields for the thin soldiers
Skinny bitch here. I'm 5'1", and I bitch about trying to find pants that don't cover my toes should I choose to be on pointe. Obviously getting fat wouldn't solve that problem.
Not OP. I submitted a verification a week ago. No answer from you guys so I deleted off imgur as I don't like my photos on the web:P
they won't get FPH down anyway, and they won't persist if somehow this sub gets down. wanna know how I know it, kid?once I was laughing at the dumb fucks of SRD and I found a (surprise surprise) dumb fuck saying nonsense about our rules. I corrected them, explained how verification worked, and someone said something like "wow, they go thru all that trouble for a flair? that's pathetic!"they think grabbing a pen, writing your username on a paper, getting up and taking a pic holding the paper is **a lot of trouble**. they think we are basement dwellers that spend the whole day on this sub because they *can't conceive* the idea that you can multitask and/or do several things in the same day without dying a little. they think we are all crazy obsessed people because we spend a couple of minutes online making fun of hams.you see what I mean? any kind of work or dedication (as minimal as it may be), persistence or endurance is unbearable to them. it's **unthinkable.** they maximize all this stuff because they *can't function like normal members of society without feeling it's too much work, too tiring*.so yeah, I think we're safe =)
I just had this conversation with my husband the other day. I had to stop buying my favorite UA running capris bc the waist in them is huge now. They are constantly falling down, but if I go down one more size they will be too tight on my thighs. I have to wear running pants with a draw string or else I'm constantly pulling them up.
Why are fat fucks always sticking out their tongue?
He is so gross
&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
IDK, the more conditioned I get the lower my "jog" feels. By the 10 minute mile standard, I haven't jogged in years. I feel like I'm jogging if I go at my long distance tempo pace.
Then your cash is going towards their hospital stay, through increased premiums on your insurance or your actual tax dollars if they go to a public hospital. Can't win.
the easiest way is to rent a bunch of flatbed trucks and deport the fatties
It's always been this way. Attractive people know they're attractive, so there's no point in even mentioning it. Ugly people want to make themselves feel better, so they claim they are "sexy" or "cute".

BMI = 38.2"But that BMI is pure inaccurate innit?"It's staggering how somebody can be only 5'2" tall and think it's normal to weigh over 200lbs.
I set it off the first day I was there for "dropping" a 50 pound dumbell at like 5 percent the speed of actual falling speed.
I got my wisdom teeth out 2 days ago... the similarity in face shape is shocking!
Lol page 69
I dub my wife "fat back" as of tonight when she gets home. I don't mean fat back as in the traditional sense either. When growing up we called hogs that were fat enough for slaughter "fat backs."
ME ME ME ME ME
Better
Even if it was only 1400, that leaves 600-1000 calories for the rest of the days meals (assuming she eats like a human) Not likely that she lost weight that day.
39 inches is the average waist of men!? God damn it's believable when you go down to Walmart man...Just think about all the fat beasts that stay home and never even come outside to be seen.
When do the X's run out? Like is there a point where they stop and just call it tarp size? Maybe the roman numeral system would be more efficient.
No, I'm pretty sure it's the physical appearance of the blubbery rolls and cellulite coupled with the grime that resides within said rolls that's disgusts me. You're asserting that everyone back then admired obese people because if what it represented, and that's false. Michelangelo's David has been the standard for the ideal physique, both then and now. Likewise, sycophants are more willing to put up with obesity when they think there's something in it for them, but that does not equate to true attraction.
I want to punch her but I don't want to touch her.
But but...starvation mode..
Don't worry. She said *desert*. All that heat is not super healthy, plus the sun is bad for your skin.
Thats... that's kinda the joke...
Stop that. Its an insult to the cows.
That's a good one!
Good choice of symbols. Any of these would weigh a man (or a woman) down for life.
You could replace her head with the head of a pig and I wouldnt be able to tell the difference...
That first image, lol; its like she is admitting she is the size of a boat. She might as well walk around with a cow-bell around her neck, or a t-shirt that says welcome to Planet Munster.
Probably the most exercise they'll get all week....
Some of the suggestions in this tread sound straight from a pro-ed forum. It's one meal, have a lighter lunch than usual and at the place get something relativity healthy, sweet potato fries or just a side salad instead of chips, some form of grilled chicken, all sauces on the side and skip the dessert. Also tell the staff you are on a low sodium diet. Eat slowly and until you are full and just go for a nice evening walk when you get home. Also you shouldn't feel anxious or stressed out in anyway by tracking your intake or making healthier choices, if you just want to have a glass of wine and sit with them while they eat they shouldn't be getting upset at you, simply tell them "the food here is unhealthy and I care about my wellbeing, more than can be said for you, I enjoy your company and want to spend the evening with you without feeling pressured to consume things that are bad for my health, would you force a cigarette into my mouth too if I said no?" Leave it at that and they will get the message loud and clear.
Losing weight is hard, but I'm realizing now that it's a lot harder to stay fat. I have a problem with my spine and shitty knees. Guess what happened when I dropped the pounds? Spine stopped hurting so much and the knee problems rarely crop up. Being fat is stupid.
I love the mods of this sub.
You have literally described what happens on this sub, all day every day.
she clearly doesn't need anymore ham
ARGH! I am so SICK of people using this as an excuse. And now we have the fat dancer on tv claiming it makes it easier to gain and more difficult to lose weight. No it does NOT! Eating endless levels of sugargrease makes it easy to gain and difficult to lose.I have PCOS and I'm a complete shitlady. Never been obese, never been even close to overweight. In fact, I've been underweight for the better part of 2014 and still have to put focused effort into getting enough calories every day.Weight gain EXACERBATES pcos, not the other way around. Pcos does not cause weight gain!!! Ugh! So irritating to see this all the time!Pcos is now the fat people disease and there's no excuse for it. This condishun being blamed for fat laziness is TOTAL BULLSHIT. STOP USING A LEGIT DISORDER AS AN EXCUSE. How awful of a person do you have to be to do something like this?!Edit: I just want to add that becoming overweight or obese is directly choosing to worsen symptoms of not only pcos, but an array of health issues. Being obese and overweight is never healthy. NEVER! WHAT THE FUCK?! IS EVERYONE TAKING CRAZY PILLS???
hahaha. "Dessert makes me feel good so I HAD to order it to feel better about myself!" Well, when you feel that little pinch of hunger my fat friend, instead of nursing it away with a twinkie, remind yourself that that's your body at work burning away those excess 250 lbs. Usually this guy is pretty decent with his youtube vids and I DO remember, in all fairness to him, about him talking about an injury that fucked up one of his knees, requiring surgery. But guess what's on the other side of that coin? A goddamn swimming pool. Can't run? Swim. Walking on a hill difficult? Swim. There's plenty of cardio to be had in a pool, even if it's walking laps in the pool, that will burn tons of calories over time. He didn't like what he was hearing so he stopped being in that situation. Great plan. "Well I don't like seeing that I don't have money in my bank account, so I'm going out to buy jeans to make me feel better and then not check my balance online". I wonder what he would say to that. Sure his friend could have been more constructive and tactful but guess what, passing the blame onto other people instead of taking responsibility is reprehensible
Can we be friends IRL?
This girl's lats are way too small for her to be on cycle. I would bet money she's natty. She maybe ran clen or DNP to cut, but no gear.
TRPer.
a few zeroes
Because finding a potential partner doesn't require you to critique their body. Except when they want a guy who's fit and 6 feet tall. Then it's OK.Fat fucks don't realize how idiotic they are.
How does it wipe its ass?
Whatever it is, I'm still not ugly, broke, born in Africa or ill.
Can confirm. Ex-coworker of mine was told by her "trainer" to eat 6 small meals a day. She ate 6 HUGE meals a day which usually consisted of dessert too. Had she eaten just 3 of those meals and less dessert she probably would have lost weight but nope.
She already made it through both. When you're at boot you don't get to wear the U.S. Marines strap on your uniform. She's got it on there, so she already passed.
I was unsure of this, thank you :) will post it over there instead.

I went to the gym recently with a friend who wanted to lose weight. After a half mile on the track he told me he's done, and that he just doesn't have the "body for cardio."No man, you don't have enough cardio for your body.
Her feels ache cause deathfats give her dirty looks for being an anorexic slut.
I can't say I disagree, but weeding out the fatties is pretty easy with the no-sympathy-tolerance policy. They always crack.
Looks like the odds are good the chair is stuck to his ass, so you have plenty of time to snap a few more pics and perp-walk away.
I'm 26, class of 2007. When I try to think about the fat kids in my grad class, I can distinctly remember four of them. We might have had a few kids in the 25-27 BMI range, possibly still losing their kid fat or on their way to getting fatter, whatever. But we had almost no one in the 30+ range. Graduated with a senior class of just under 300 kids.My brother is a freshman in high school now in the same school district. I'll have to ask him how bad it is. I shall report back.
Why would anyone think men need more of those things? More to taste? Are you fucking kidding? I'm perfectly happy with the normal amount.
Oh sorry to mislead you - I'm not aware of one for microbes, I use one that tests the water to make sure all the chemical levels are correct for a swimming pool. Now - people swimming fully clothed? Dude, what?? are there no rules at all at that pool? That sounds terrible.
Just know I'll remember the run (tee hee) we had here forever. I'll be telling the fat nurses at the old folks home exactly what fph would have thought of them.
He is only 30 thats still young. haha.

tfw fat starts to engulf your eyes
I'm guessing you're kind of short then? I weigh 200 pounds right now at 6'3", and my body fat is around 13% - 15%. Anyway, I'm glad you decided to lose the weight, and become a human being!
Why would you need stairs if you have dragons?Oh, wait.
Fucking HELL this was funny! If this happened to me I would be on the floor laughing I would be unable to function. In a Dairy Queen parking lot no less. PRICELESS!Side note: My inner skinny bitch cried with laughter at the SHOES omg the hideous shoes it had.edit: a word
All right, just for you. In all seriousness though, the obesity-related horrors we see in healthcare are essentially limitless now.
&gt;mizmoose 1 point : 30 minutes ago replyFrom a humanity POV this is horrific. From a history POV it's fascinating to see how far we've come.From a humanity POV, it's horrific that we hadn't executed the lot of them by the 1940s. From a history POV, we've gone quite a distance in the wrong direction by accepting niggers and other non-Whites into our lands. We'll return to the path of righteousness soon.
I didn't mean to come across as argumentative towards yourself, I phrased it poorly. Thank you for explaining the difference, where we get our food from is of great interest to me - I have never met a Vegan but am very curious about its origins.You would be very happy if you ever kept chickens!
Another interesting fact: If a fat guy showed up at your door-step naked with ketchup and mustard spilled all over himself, the world wouldn't end. You'd still be fucking disgusted though, wouldn't you?

Fat people go out of their way to get their feelings hurt because the world literally and figuratively revolves around them.
She probably ate a lot of them back "fueling" during her "run." Then ate them back again once the "run" was over.
I love this.
In Denmark you are lucky to find it lower than $5 a pound:S Damn, I'm envious.
Looks like a craigslist ad. Seems like a perfectly good sales tactic to part the stupid from their wallets.
can confirm, best friend in middle school had a fat mom who floated without treading water. all her kids together couldnt sink her.nice lady tho. mormons are so hard to hate.
Oh man such good flair ideas
Yup. "Please. Please dear cat jesus. Hear me now in my time of need... I am alive and I breath and I like scratches. Please dont eat me like I saw you did to that other animal for breakfast. Amen"
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
I am the same way. It's the distribution of fat. I gain fat in my lower half way before my upper body.
Yea I wouldn't put my dick anywhere near this she beast.
Gonna need James Cameron to find that one.

When it's healthy, yeah, but fatty's starts looking like fluffy pubes from the elbow down.Give me a girl with long, well-maintained hair any day!
It must be all those fresh fruit and vegetables he eats.
Exactly. Obese people who are able to maintain normal BP, blood levels, etc. while they are young are able to do so because the body is sacrificing itself in order to compensate! The heart muscle is so overworked it gets larger and larger as a result of the extra stress. Obviously this cannot go on indefinitely and sooner or later KABOOOOOM
I have found in my studies that most normal mothers with both short and longer labors had bigger babies. I personally had my first daughter at home via a natural birth. After 33 hours of labor (luckily it was an easy labor), she was 9 lbs. For my second daughter, I had her in the hospital (last night on fact, she has been sleeping a lot- I am bored out of my mind now that the welcome wagon has departed and irritated with my fat hospital roommate). I had to be induced due to a genetic heart issue that I too had at birth With all of the drugs, she came out after six hours of labor at 8 lbs 9 oz. My midwife said even without the drugs it would have likely been less than 10 hours, especially since she's my second. Every women labors differently, that's for sure, but there are certain things, like being a healthy weight, that can influence what happens. I'm glad that you had a nice, healthy-sized baby!!
Savage OP, just savage. That was amazing!

It's $10/month and closest to my place. But there's a lot of wacky stuff going on there: people standing around, people working out in belted jeans, belted slacks, button down shirts, gardening gloves, people doing the strangest exercises, setting their phones on benches to reserve them while they tour the gym, setting a bag towel and multiple weights on a bench to reserve it while they tour the gym, using exercise balls with the smith machine, and there's much more. On the other hand there are plenty of fit/built members but the majority are just a big bowl of smh/wtf.
What are you talking about? I don't usually comment here so you would be quoting stuff from mostly /r/soccer lmao.
I mean, it's a little silly to get so angry at one hate sub when you're a racist who openly hates black people.
"I will never fucking wear this again"
She is so visually repulsive I can't even comprehend how anyone would want to be like that! Super Morbidly Obese, grotesque as all hell, fat asshole. Diabeetus is on the way!

Especially considering you have to choose again and again to eat too much. Having a baby could be as simple as unprotected (or a failure of protection) sex once.
I hear they drink liquid things, like molten chocolate and stuff.
I don't know if it's a weird angle or something, but the dog looks fat too. Poor thing is being made like its owner.

Good God that ass is disgusting! It doesn't even have the form of an ass! It looks like a partially deflated beach ball!!!
I had a date with an Army guy last night and the first thing I told him was "Hi, I'm LolaBadassPants. I have my own health insurance, and I'm not here for your future pension or your Tricare." (He's a three time Iraq vet who was wounded.) Yup, he's been texting me ever since.
Her smile is reminiscent ov overly-attached girlfriend
Most likely she is attached to a man she feels confident will stay no matter how fat she gets. She shouldn't feel too confident though. Men leave.
Well, that happens all the time.
I've never had a sugars daddy but I work with money on daily basis and I can say that men who spend cash on women expect either luxury aka return on an investment. That ain't it.

Yep, I couldn't eat anymore. I was damn hungry because it was at this lake party thing and I'd been out on the water all day before, but I just got up and left.

The horse breed in question - probably a Walker - is one of about five types that are 'gaited'. So you have your four regular horse movements, walk/trot/canter/gallop, but gaited horses have an extra movement or two - Paso Finos have one called a paso, Tennessee Walking horses and other American breeds have a gait called a running walk which is shown in this picture. It's basically a more comfortable, effective way of moving (hails back to when cowboys used to ride for hours on end over long distances). The big pads on this poor sods feet will have been nailed on to encourage them to pick their feet up more. As it hurts the horse to pick their feet up, they try and get away from the pressure by lifting them higher. It's fucked up.Worth noting that in other disciplines, we have issues such as nails in jump poles (show jumping, so the horse doesn't rap the pole), 'rollkur' in dressage (pulling the horses nose into it's chest so far it can barely breathe so when you go in the ring their head position is let out and they make a prettier picture) and the whole general shit storm that is racing (the majority of UK racehorses start their careers at 2 years old which is the same as making a 8 year old child run a marathon in stress levels). The horse world is really fucked up at times.
I saw it more as she used her hair to hide the face fat on the sides and was just able to find the perfect angle to highlight her features and hide the proportions. She really would be gorgeous if she looked how she wants to look. That last pic made me very sad.
Maybe the shitlord maggots will eat them next! :)

Fat people need their own special fat seating in the back of the bus. Obeasts only (unless there are no landwhales on the bus.) We'll cram them all into the back and they can enjoy the fine aromas and sights of their own kind.Just call me Slim Crow. 8)Edit: While we're at it, special eatbeast drinking fountains would be good. They'll cry about oppressions, but the truth is that nobody can oppress them as much as their fat deposits oppress their internal organs.

Hmm. Where I am, sushi stores are a very popular grazing ground for the local hams. They eat there because sushi is always 'healthy', even when they order the deep fried shrimp with extra sweet chilli sauce. Every time I see them there they will have at least two boxes of the worst choices in sushi available.

The best part about this? Your "Fuck them, I'm eating as much as I can to spite them" meal is almost definitely still less than what they eat as a normal meal on their lunch breaks.I had a Facebook friend once that worked at McDonald's. All the fucking time she'd post a picture of her "Half price lunch, teehee!". I think I lasted like 3 days before I blocked her. Normally it was two giant fucking burgers (I don't even know what the fuck they're called), a large fry and a large drink. Then she'd take chocolate chip cookies and MIX THEM INTO A FUCKING OREO MCFLURRY.Thin privilege is not eating like you're high as fuck when you're sober.

Yes.* The prices of medication that treats things caused by obesity should be rocketed sky high.* Clothing for obeasts should be coated with a stench that smells like a rotting skunk, but a stench that only obeasts can smell.* Changing rooms must be resized to fit only a single person who fits a size large. Basically, it should be around the width of a normal bathroom stall and have the length the same as the width.* Scooty Puffs should reside within a locked room and must be requested to use.* Scooty Puffs should only recognize up to 200lbs, and after that break catastrophically enough that anyone who breaks them with their weight must pay their money. Also the scooty puff doesn't move anymore if they're broken via weight.* Remove escalators from malls* Lock elevators in malls. Customers who need to use them must go to a nearby employee of the mall, who will then unlock the elevator if the customer is deemed to be disabled enough to require it.* Ban TiTP and anyone who uses fat-positive tags on Tumblr* There should be a separate elevator for obeasts in skyscrapers, but not one that can handle heavier people. So that when their combined weights break the elevators, sites like TiTP will go mad with the revelation that a fat person's weight affected someone else.

Fruit juice is expensive and awful.My kid's pediatrician asked if we gave any, and went on to say that if you have any fruit, eat the fruit, don't buy juice. She was happy our munchkin loves veggies and really didn't pimp the giving of fruit at all. Too much sugar.

This frustrates me to no end. I am a foodie, I love to cook and eat. Am I overweight? No. Because I can moderate. It's not that complicated. I'd also rather eat at home and have a fantastic meal at a 5 star restaurant than pig out oh fast food every other day.
Shut the fuck up and get out until you cross that finish, fatty.

As the two lore master's words collide in an ancient myriad of prophetic wisdom, the words shine in a magical glow of divine knowledge.

There is a big difference between "malnourished" and "starving".The book "Poor Economics" for example mentions studies done in India where people actually went from sufficient calories to malnourished after an increase in income, because they would change the kind of food they ate. Malnourishment has a lot to do with culture and knowledge as well, not just with availability of calories.

No. As an avid bubble bath enthusiast, I have never gotten bath water trapped in my cooch nor have any of my *fit* friends. I do know a large girl who has a similar issue with farts not getting past he fat ass and going into her snatch instead. I think it might literally be a problem with her fat thighs holding her vagina lips shut or something so any bath water that might seep in can't escape.. Idk how it got in there in the first place though. Vaginas kinda close themselves unless aroused .
She must be in the zoo.
Trash bin lol.
If you eat 5000 kcal of vegetables, you're gonna have a bad time. .

Throw fruit at them, it will startle and confuse them and they will retreat, solid plan.
So much woman. Cant even
They are so stuck on fat acceptance that they lack the common sense to realize that when VS says "body" they are actually talking about boobs....
I have no idea why people think running 5k is an achievement. Most normal people will complete in under 30 mins without much training. 30 mins running, isn't something to be proud of. I'd guess most people that stay in shape run perhaps 30-40km every week?
Has to be. I've never seen healthy tissue discolored like that.
I spent the night in the ER once for over-intoxication (alcohol) and when the obese doctor came into my room the next day to tell me what to do once I left, she told me not to drink but was way more serious and almost mad when she told me not to smoke "pot."It was legitimately hard not to tell her to lay off the McDonald's.
The whale "wasn't _as_ packed in"? Bullshit! _Of course fatties should buy two seats because they take up two seats!_P.S. I'm flying for five hours in coach tomorrow. Pray for me.
If I ever go to states, it would be like an even shittier version of Pokemon Snap; only with fatties instead of pokemons.^except^snorlax^huehue
They are so stupid they might just do that
Exactly! I'm glad someone else noticed that :)
I like that they do it. It's like they're serving you their insecurity and self-hatred on a crumb-coated platter.
The toilet?
You seem to be missing any surrounding context to this picture.
Chances are you're eating a carb heavy breakfast. The resulting insulin spike/drop is what's making you more inclined to eat later on.
Or the ocean.
The problem is that you would have to go by BMI or something. Otherwise tall people would be fucked.
Death of chair? Or death of him? Actually, why not both?
I saw my first waddler in a while recently. Rather than walking like humans tend to do, it looked like every single step demanded her full attention. "Okay, now I'm going to put my left leg forward. And not it's time for the right. And now the left again..."
[Picture from above eatbeast "fashion" blog](URLDear god what the hell is that thing coming out of her shirt? Muffin top doesn't do it justice.
Obese girls can't really put their hands on their hips can they? It looks like they're just resting their hands on their belly, because it takes up 70% of their torso.
The sad thing is that they could use the time they spend doing their makeup going to the gym or for a run instead.
True, I just see a lot of people who say they are skinny but just have a 'beer belly' or whatever.
The lack of common sense and awareness baffles me every time.
You need to fuck off. Banned
I didn't realize uggs were so expensive.They're so popular, I assume they must be really comfy.
Problem is that there are so many fat people in the world that they are not in the minority in most western societies, you can go anywhere in America, Australia Or even Europe and find at least one group of fatties who hold the "HAES" mentality and they feed off each other, constantly believing "We are healthy, thin people are the sick ones" and it's like a real life circle jerk. Which grows and grows as people pass down their deluded vision of "health" to their children.
Christ, I thought he was licking the last bit of cake batter out of the bowl...IN THE CAR!
Do they really think 100 signatures would change any of the mods minds?Maybe they're banking on the fact that 1 fatty = 5 normal people size wise soooo...500 signatures?
They sound fat
ahhh, going through this made me hungry...But then I remembered the butterbeast that ate all this food and my appetites gone for a year.
They want people to believe that they are fat through no fault of their own.
Yeah, my worry is that as Korea continues to develop, the fats I see will overtake just as they have done in the West...
She's probably used to waking up in a puddle of her own feces.

Ugh, not having any kind of waist kind of defeats the whole point of the waist belts, it just becomes a breast holder/fupa squisher. You can't shape a sphere with a tiny strip of leather!
We made it guys.
Chur bro!
The fucking camera shakes before he even lifts it off the ground.
I have to say that is very interesting and the failure of the concept is no big (tee hee) surprise. Hams are basically dumb, grown up children with zero impulse control. Add an unlimited supply of cheap, unhealthy food, and you get an obesity crisis that is getting worse by the day.

Are these people so deluded that they think they can go through life being Fat and no one ever is going to call them out? Like - are they snowflakes or something?There are people in this world who try to do the MOST good they can, and they are the victims of Real criticism all the time - All.the-fuckin-time.No one is beyond criticism in this life, no one. You're fat? You're going to get a lot of it, deal with it. What? Are we supposed to treat you good cus you are a human being or whatever? Fuck you.Welcome to life.

And none of those things are going to stress the medical system to the breaking point. Otherwise I'm suffering from the ginger epidemic. Whoopty do.
Fat ham since birth. Poor fella doesn't stand a chance.
That's not a stupid question at all! Personally, I am not a medical doctor and am unable to get into a super detailed medical reason as to why, but I can answer this based on my own observations that have held an emphasis on cultural causes and effects. In my own ethnographic research, the overweight/obese women that opt for c-sections either do so out of necessity or choice. Generally, more overweight/obese women refuse to attempt vaginal delivery than women of a normal weight will. Instead, they elect to deliver their baby via c-section. Those that have to delivery the baby via c-section usually must do so due to a variety of pregnancy complications that have resulted from their weight. Usually these issues relate to diabetes, hypertension, or the like. Occasionally, they say that their hips bones will be too narrow to delivery the baby, but the doctors I have spoken to say that's very rare, so it's probably a cop-out.Another reason many obese women have to get c-sections is due to the drugs that they take for labor. When a woman decides not to have a natural childbirth, she will be given a lot of drugs to speed up labor and relieve pain. Obese women generally have shorter labors, so, when the drug to speed up labor is given, the baby is put under A LOT of stress. This will usually then lead to an emergency c-section. I hope this answers your questions!
Wtf. This entire thing is such bullshit. I couldn't watch more than 5 minutes so I don't know if this is addressed but if her husband is her full time carer why is he buying her junk?! I'd be like bitch, all you're getting is salad for the next year, and if you complain you're getting nothing at all. Then again he doesn't look like he knows what salad is. That one sister doesn't look fat, she should do something.
i can almost guarantee that this is someone who just wants to jerk off to being humiliated. tell them you'll do it for 2.99/min.
Tell Walmart to do something about it. Claim assault and harassment in their stores. Force their hand. Security cameras all up in that bitch to cover you.
I thought it was fairly well known that women outnumber men on FPH.
YOU CAN'T USE LOGIC HERE! MY FEE FEES!!!!!
Oh, no worry, *gravity* will take care of that
What if he brings a bunch of fatties here, and they grease up the place with their body cheese and stank-ass? Protect us, Mods!
No, no, no. Anything that comes out of her maw I wouldn't able to take seriously. And of course if I were to say something EXACTLY like that to a room full of lardies Tumblr would be set afire.
Thanks man, what would I do without you.
Goodness, can't the cognitive dissonance be more obvious? The ham is obviously trying so hard to come up with ways to soothe its fee fees against the shitlord clothes' companies.
Yeah... because healthy people have backfat. Yuck.
At least they are working their fingers! /sALL SHITLORDS! We are getting through their fucking fat brains! HAM LURKERS, DIE!
I'm in a similar situation. I had size C breasts when I was 8 and they have been DDD since I was 18. I work out every day (including back strengthening exercises), I have a BMI of 22.5, and I suffer from back pain all the time. Breast reduction seems like it would be more helpful to skinny people rather than hamplanets anyway because even if the hams remove weight from their breasts, they still have to carry around all of their stomach rolls.
It's rubbish^(I got called out :( I repeat myself a lot)
The pigs would call the second girl anorexic and say she needs to eat a sandwich.
Update!
&gt; “Students of color reported feeling uncomfortable and unwelcomed just walking into or sitting in the classroom, especially if they were the only person of color, or one of a few,”Are you kidding me? How is this a microaggression? This is normal for everyone, regardless of race, gender, etc. If I'm in a place filled with all black people or what have you, I might feel a little uncomfortable because I am the one person that's different. If a guy is in a room full of girls, wouldn't he feel a little uncomfortable, because again, he is the only different one (same with a girl and a room full of guys)? I'd feel uncomfortable if I went to a party and everyone was wearing fucking suits and I was wearing jeans and a t-shirt. Calling this a microaggression is ridiculous. /rant
2 years ago I had a great excuse to order a double fudge brownie sundae with whip cream, caramel, hot fudge sauce, peanuts and two kinds of heavy ass buttery ice cream. It was great for 3 bites and then I had 2.5pounds of delicious food I had to throw away. I learned my lesson and never ordered ice cream like that again. I like places where you make your own and pay by weight, then you can make a tiny one and enjoy it without feeling like a wasteful idiot!
OP are you fat or not?
I don't know if the lady with disabilities said this or not, but you just know if that woman had a 5% chance of walking again, she would do *everything* in her power to achieve it. Some cancers have a 95% chance of death. Are we supposed to just say fuck it and let the person die? Even if there's a large chance that if they do survive, they're getting a few years at best? Hell fucking no.Obesity is a disease. They should treat it like the plague it is.

I definitely need this in three different colors so that I can wear it on gym days(I got to planet fitness with a friend.) Seeing the looks on all the stupid ham faces is going to be amazing.
I just read Robert Faurisson's review of Shoah. Wish I would have read that back in the late 80's after I watched Shoah. It was very grim and tiresome to watch. Lots of railroad tracks, boxcars, and cold looking countryside filmed on overcast days. I cannot believe I never saw Triumph of the Will until a few years ago.
My first thought was kids. I never even thought about the fatties in their beetus carts!
Well Phil Jupitus and Peter Kay are both huge and very funny. So pretty fat.

"a state of affairs or an event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often amusing as a result."If I were shaped like that woman, I would make a pretty concerted effort to *not* look like my stuffed pig, and I thus consider doing so to be contrary to a reasonable person's behavior and humorous in result.

Haha i just lol'd at work bc of this but i mean think about it. The fat people all share the same mentality essentially that everyone else is the problem. What if there was a fucked up chromosome that can be found as a common problem is fat people. Yes im saying that they are fucked genetically from birth to become fat. Why cant we as shitlords use this to our advantage and eliminate the problem in the beginning??? Ya know like hey this baby has x chromoskme which is known to make people turn out fat lets go ahead and shoot it. Make a better world lol. Im an extremist in the shitlord front and would gladly eradicate the fatties without mercy. Be the next Hitler of fat asses. Me and my swole buddy were talking and were thinking of different concentration camps to put them in. Like the fatties who legitimately want to lose weight and do get a chance to be reintegrated into society and if they become fat shoot them. The fatties who refuse are shot on sight. Thw fatties who lose weight then give up get hung from a crane thats able to handle their weight. No mercy to the fats

Looks out homie. I got banned for threatening to kill fatties before. Some mods here are touchy...
Pretty much the same thing but with a more asinine combination of words.
Well if being 'fat is genetic' and all fat people were to die, ..something something Darwin.. = a fat-free society!
For the first time the title made me cringe more than the content.
People just love to get offended I guess. :/On a serious note, I have never been in a community as welcoming, accepting and diverse as FPH. Granted, you have to be a shitlord to be here and agree with the hate.Also, no fatties. The based mods will risk life and limb to make it so.Edit : They will risk imaginary internet points : )

Didn't evn notice it was a tablet, had to double check.
I lifted my way to an hourglass and I'll be damned if they take it. I hate the clothing annoyances but when I find the right clothes for my shape I feel like such a BAMF.
That will have something to do with having to fit a fat girl into them. Surely that shouldnt come as a surprise.
At least here they never have a running car. You see Buicks walking everywhere pushing there fat spawn in strollers. I can't comprehend how you can be so fat and walk everywhere. Our public transit might as well not exist. The online dating scene here is all hams with 1-3 kids between.
Yeah and it's almost acceptable to stick your cock into a dead chick as long as you heat her up first...
Yeah they look proper mouldy. They literally look like spoiled food, which is funny, because that's what they're made of!

I'm a dude, 3% is competing body builder level. I don't have the discipline for that. I'm on a bulk right now so my body fat will creep up then the journey down to 10% body fat (the point I have a six pack) begins!I actually agree with the hambeasts that bmi is limited, due to muscles not being accounted for, but they can't hide from body fat measures!

She joined the gym at New Year's one year. She stayed for twenty minutes and walked one mile per hour while ~~snacking~~ gorging on chips, cupcakes, doughnuts, pizza, etc. She saw no immediate results so she spent two hours crying while shoveling ice cream into her mouth with an actual shovel. She blamed genetics, the diet industry, body image issues, and/or black magic on her incompetence. She proceeded to instead demand that people accept her disgusting lard-ass instead of improving herself.I'd bet my life savings that something like that happened after she joined a gym, if she did at all.
This comment is utterly beautiful. Well done, shitlord.Tenn Monster is truly taking the black hole of a stomach analogy to another world. I pity the bakeries in her vincinity.

God damn this thing is ugly! Lamo
See, the thing is it's also possible (although not encouraged) to eat KFC and McDonalds, and not gain weight. How? Watch your calories. If you eat trash and you still are capable of controlling your calories, you can lose weight as well.[Some dude ate ONLY TWINKIES, but watched his calories and bam, HE STILL LOST WEIGHT. Best part?

Fat, lazy, parents are both depressing and infuriating. Imagine how much better that kid's childhood/life would be if he had parents who were active and did things like played sports with them.
Funny how the guy is skinny... fucking gross hypocrite hams
If I remember correctly it's been around even before that, and people would mentally-ill-logic themselves into believing that not eating was a way to be pure for God.
Yup! Same principle.
Horizontal stripes on clothes make you look wider than vertical stripes. True story.
I think they should also post WHR there. 5'4" 140lbs lifter with a whr of 0.6-0.7 is very different to 5'4" 140lbs couch-potato with a whr of 1.
Also I'm still young so I grew an inch while gaining weight, and my boobs doubled in size. So that part of the weight I'm going to try to keep. Edit : If gaining a mere 10 pounds can turn you into a fatty, you probably weren't that fit to begin with. You have no idea where I started out before gaining weight and a 12 really isn't that big depending on what store you're in, it's just devestating to go from a 4 to a 12. (Note: I carry almost all my weight in my hips.) I'm so small that if I drink and eat too much one day, I'll wake up 5 pounds heavier. I plan on losing about 5 more pounds and toning my body because I already look and feel great. You should focus less on accusing people of being fat because you sound like an idiot. At my age, 10 pounds is nothing and I currently wear a size 6. I currently have more muscle than I did before I gained weight, so there's that too. Look at your own body and tell me, if you gained 10 pounds would you be a fatty? If so, you're not in good shape to begin with.
First comment on this sub... I've had this exact situation happen to me countless times. Someone comes crying to me for help because I'm the only person in the office with a physique, and give me the same story. "Boo hoo me I tried dieting and exercise but nothing works how do you do it? What fat burner pill should I buy?" Instead of being judgmental, I take time out of my day to create an easy to follow meal plan and workout routine. One of the hams did it for two days. Two fucking days. Third day I ask him if he's ready to hit the gym, and he goes "my lungs have been feeling tight lately. I'm gonna wait until the situation clears up before I start to work out again." Of course, that was the end of that. The best part is, two months later he comes back to me, says he's all healed and ready to give it another go. Except he wants me to re-create another workout routine and meal plan. This time I wised up and told him I was done trying to help him and he could find all the information he'd ever need, like everyone else does, online.
This story (and the addendum about her removing her sling) honestly sound completely made up. This is fat people hate, not fat people stories (or whatever that fat people fan fiction sub is)- you dont need to fabricate a villainous story to get us on board. She could be presenting a 5 million dollar check to orphans and we'd still be like "she probably ate their parents"
I think the fastest is 3.35?
Gym 4 days a week and watching calories.... Hmm so sat and looked at a phone or tried to look cute and ate normally is what I read.Increase physical activity gym 4 times a week lets assume she is insanely lazy an only burns 100 cal a visit and can cut 125 cal a day as well.400cal a week at the gym 875 cal a week daily deficit. Boom 2.0 lbs lost over a month, and that pitiful if all u can do is that. If that is a struggle how do they make it through life? If you can't adjust your eating to do something that small she will only get bigger with time, and has no self discipline.
Fat people need to do a lot of things. But if they did them, chances are they wouldn't be fat.
On Mcdonalds....TIL micky d's is one hell of a drug.

Yeah she's for sure overweight but I would not be put off by her weight at all. When I think of curves, that is closer to what I think of. And then there's the deathfats that say they have curves...no. What put me off about that pic was all the fatspo shit on the bottom.
This is why the show is still on the air after 26 seasons.
A nutrition professor a couple years ago proved you could eat nothing but twinkies and convenience store snacks and lose weight. Its a simple energy balance. Burn more than you ingest.
It still wouldn't make her gain 200lbs all on it's own though, is my point. Some medications do do that but it isn't the sole cause of extreme weight gain
How did they link it to you?
Jesus, lady. That's not how you do it.
I read that whole column and in my head i was just all WAH WAH WAH WAH WAH WAH WAH. cuz...damn. adults who get all pantytwisted over people being mean to them on twitter are just sad.

I actually just picked up rock climbing about 2 months ago, its fucking glorious you know why? No landwhales, no fartcannons, infact I don't think I've seen a single person over 15% body fat while rock climbing.
The video is 5 years old. What do you think that thing weighs now?(Do you think it's dead?)
No doubt about it! I occasionally get hit on by other men (straight man here as well) and it's always flattering, gay dudes have pretty good taste so that speaks well of me in the moment IMO.Fatties have horrible taste; not only that, I do NOT want to looked at like someone wants to eat me. Thats just scary.
"Sloot" is used as a replacement word for "slut" on bodybuilding.com's Misc forum. I wouldn't be surprised if this dude is a poster on that site.Anyway, he went hard on that fat bitch. I lol'd all the way through. I hate using this but it works so well here: Rekd't
Well my guess is they keep their lazy Westerner fatlogic.I took up 3 seats in American trains - so it's fine for me to take up 5 in Asia, they are all skinny bitches who oppress me by standing longer than 3 minutes anyway! *huff puff*Then they are bound to judge you're amazing food, as - this isn't food it's rabbit food, I don't know what I'm eating so I'mJust going to say it's bad and go get me 8 triple cheeseburgers to snack on while they make my enormous order of big macs with extra grease oh and a diet beetus. (Can't forget that!!)
For me it's potato soup with sweet dumplings with a salty crust and vanilla sauce. Heaven... Luckily I don't eat it very often.
Foot placement is personal preference though. For instance, I like my feet wider, but I also have an issue with my IT band that causes patellar strain, which I have found through trial and error is aggervated by keeping my legs narrower like that. I like about 6" past shoulder-width.
Thanks for commenting. I love the subreddit, but I just can't push myself to hate on the kids. I feel fucking bad for them.
I like to think I'm a feminist because I want equal rights for both genders and not at the expense of either. But if you're fat, you're fat. It's not healthy and that's all there is to it. I know the media puts pressure on women to look a certain way but it's not like we're saying everyone needs to be a super model. Just...stop overeating, blaming nonexistant health conditions for your weight and be in a healthy range.These women give those of us non-delusional feminists a bad name. So tired of it.
I would repost to porn blogs just to spite them, but that would mean that some poor sap would end up fapping to it.
It happens because their organs and everything else in their body has a much higher strain on them.Imagine having to squat at least 100lbs everytime you want to stand up from your couch. Imagine having to carry 100lbs around with you everytime you go grocery shopping, or go up stairs, or go partying(although I assume that's a thing she doesn't do - too much exercise). Imagine how exhausted you'd be at the end of the day. Now imagine that happens every fucking day, for several years, nonstop, everytime you do *anything* that's not just lying down. And even then, when lying down, the weight puts pressure onto your chest, making breathing harder.That's why fat people age fast. They put their body through fucking hell.
Yep. You went full tumblr.
Or they'd have a large number of fatties working on a shared goal. See how SRS doxes people.

The saddest part is that most fat girls actually have pretty faces. But they destroyed their natural beauty with shitty life choices. I blame the parents. Fat Parents raise fat kids---&gt;fat kids grow up to be fat adults---&gt;fat adults become fat parents. It's a vicious cycle.

Snacking.
Vomiting after you eat is actually not a very efficient way to lose weight.
This. They may even be within normal weight range but they look like shit. Even if you're not technically fat, being lazy and sedentary will make you look awful. The terrible posture by itself makes you look 20-30 pounds heavier.
Healthy food is completely irrelevant when you are consuming 4000 calories of "healthy food". YThey can eat cookies, big macs and Twinkies all day and lose weight if they want.. As long as they eat under their TDEE. The fact she claims to run marathons and do all this exercise even makes it worse. If she is still picking up weight or even maintaining weight with all that exercise, she must really be sucking down the calories.
&gt;The burden of proof is always on the party making the positive assertion.[Here you go my friend.](URLAnd then what? Some more petty insults? You're the one making an *unconventional* claim.

dude all these long drawn out analysis of mde's fan base are gay would you guys just watch the videos and send them money and call it a day
I am a timekeeper yes if you turn me upside down sand-grains will fall.Nahh just a joke on the fact fat people say they have an hourglass shape when they're actually an apple. To be fair though my measurements are 36-27-36 so technically yeah I am an hourglass.
Shout out to all the fatties: fuck you
It's just called hurt
spray paint
We can always spread around other ways. I found this sub through a completely different website. And the message will never stop as long as people keep eating themselves to death.
actually laughed at this. thanks person
What boggles me is that there are only a few male FA ''activists'' (term used loosely)and a shitload of female ones
diets dont work bro, jeez dont you know anything, gosh HAES
I bet they would go on Tumblr and tag themselves as something with fat in the title. Like FatBitches.

"I was born this way"Jeez, his poor cavernous mother...
Hey man, just wanted to say thanks for the link, very interesting read.
At my job, I've seen thin people use them. I always assumed they had an injury because you'd see the leg in a pretty unnatural position. I've seen thin old blue haired people use them and I assume they've earned it. Once all of our scooters were in use so a moderate weight granny had to use a bariatric wheel chair. She was just swimming in it.
The swole guys raided the sub and took over a post, called OP a skinny little bitch (he is, photo evidence), and then AlphaSwole laid in to the Moderators with logic until the Moderator had to end the conversation with "Banned" because he was being made to look ridiculous. It's now getting passed around Reddit and the whole place looks bad. Bad as in weak and pathetic, not as in "mean". It was like watching the jocks pushing the weak kids about in school again. What makes it worse is that a decent amount of fatlogic was used in defense, such as "I can't put on weight because of my metabolism" aka "mah condishuns", so now you can add hypocrisy to the mix, completely undermining any semblance of a point the sub might of had.
there's some overlap, it's a little frustrating. the college down the street near me is doing stuff for women's history month, and there's a docu showing I want to go to tomorrow, but I'm a little concerned it'll be full of fatties who will get mad at the "light refreshments" that are supposedly going to be available.I see a lot of students from there who are quite large and don't seem to take care of themselves and it makes me sad. hopefully there'll be some good people at this showing, but I'm a little anxious/worried anyhow.
The flaming baseball cap is a nice touch.
I'm full grown and full white. Never seen this bitch before but I hate her on principle.
&gt; God, this is the worst wedding photo idea I've ever seen. It could never rise above the bowels of r/trashy, even if you replaced them with fit people.Yes. This is one fat people wedding pic that could not be improved by replacing everyone with thin/fit people. It would still be classless trash.
So everyone keep telling me. I guess I severely overestimated the amount of people that go vegan for the purpose of trying to have a healthy diet versus the amount that do it for the whole "don't hurt animals" aspect.
Cool! I've been a long time lurker. It will be nice to know if I am full blown official shit lord!
I'm not saying you're lying, I just can't find anything that mentions the cop's race.Do you have a link?

Yeah when I was 150 pounds, I was a size 12 in dresses. My stomach bulged out and I was losing my chin. Size 14 is not chubby that's fat.

Ima call /r/thathappened on this. It all seems waaay too stereotypical to be true.

She's gonna stop a few seconds later, say that was quite the workout, breathe hard and wheeze for a solid 30 minutes, then say she needs to get some food because that made her so hungry and reward herself with a couple of extra hamburgers and an extra large shake instead of a large.
Yup, I'm actually pretty impressed with fat people who lose the weight. Takes a shit ton of hard work, which is why most never lose it and are fat in the first place
Literally looks like a man in a female fat suit, like Asian Big Mommas House
I'm not even sure what you're getting at here. Are you from GroidHunt? got an invite?
Yup, totally genetics.My DM for pathfinder is from a fat family, and one of his sisters is toned/lean and hella attractive.. Unlike the rest of them. *GENETICS*My family is all within healthy BMI besides an aunt and her children.. Her daughter recently lost and has been keeping off the weight now that she's an adult.. *GENETICS*My ex-roommates mother was a size 4 before giving birth to her and is now maybe a size 16? She put on and kept on that weight for 24 years blaming the pregnancy. Everyone else in that family is a BMI of 18-23. My ex-roommate is now pregnant and has put on maybe one or two pounds in the first 17 weeks? *GENETICS*
I don't get it. I'm not a face book user, but on reddit you automatically upvote your own post. I don't see a difference.

My theory is the need to validate their existence. Since, IRL, no one cared to acknowledge them much, if at all. So they need to have LOTS OF PROOF that they matter, that they are real. Whatevs.

I was looking at the comment below the two and thinking, "Who the fuck actually likes Olive Garden?" It makes me cringe so hard to hear people say they like Olive Garden. In my opinion though I thought the reply to the girl was a little mean. That may just be me cause I don't like being an asshole to someone after they've complimented me even if their grammar sucks and they're fat.
You could divorce her.
She's trying to determine if she could eat the children and then blame it on a shark. She seems torn, but I guess that could also be gas.

I found and read her post about the cookie stealing. Thank god this entitled amorphous blob was terminated. I also spent far too much of my valuable time trolling her post history. A couple highlights:* her SO cheated on her — presumably because she is fat and vile* her step-daughter said she hates her — presumably because she is fat and vile* she tried to kick her SO's roommate out — presumably because she is fat and vile and *here's hoping* the roommate was a ShitLady.PSA for all children considering a HamPlanet lifestyle: This is what happens to your life when you become gross and disgusting — you get fired, your SO cheats on you, and your children hate you.

Fuck yes
What an unfortunately ugly being. Dem genes :/
It drives me insane when all the fatties cry oppression and shaming because they can't find cute clothes in every store.I've never been able to easily find clothes that fit due to being insanely freaking tall. I'm also a UK size 16/18, even though I have a healthy BMI so I'm screwed both ways. But here's the thing - I don't feel persecuted, victimised or shamed. Just slightly inconvenienced.
well we gotta know what concert it was OP!
Perfect analogy.
Banning sprinkles definitely doesn't affect me, because I don't eat sprinkles. They aren't food. Anyone who is upset about this should hang themselves.
If this happens, get ahold of the store manager and report it. Maybe one day they'll put up signs that the scooters are for the disabled and elderly.
Another fat role model for all those 'thyroid-oppressed' people. Congrats. You have money and a fantastic job. You also have major medical problems coming your way. Kudos. We're all very proud.

he know not what the word diet means
To answer no, they don't realize at all. They don't know how many calories they should be eating to begin with.. Wait they're fat so they don't give a shit about that.
Oh for real. I totally hate on mine secretly. I guess in a way it does kinda border on eating disorder territory since they are my "triggers", sitting at the dinner table and watching them eat totally makes me want to push the plate away (the noises, the food stuffing in mouth in huge portions, the lack of chewing, the grunting...it's so gross). Luckily I'm grown now with my own family and with exception to the holidays I don't have too much daily contact with them anymore.
No.
That is highly unfair to the gay community.

Why is it so hard to think that men DO crave sex first... I do, that's what makes me attracted to a women... visual ques...For women is all about the mental and when fat women complain about men only wanting sex... it's the exact fucking thing a fat guy complains about when they say "friend zone" neither are the negative secrets... they're very open and boldly used in today's society... and yet excuse makers think that it's not a biological internal chemical check off when you find yourself attracted to someone sexually...Why is this still so hard? and why do fattys of both bulls and cows still think attraction is negotiable on their terms I'll never understand... like my feeling I'm having towards not wanting to date you are wrong and I should sacrifice those and live in misery so you can be happy. Sounds selfish as fuck.Girls want a guy? Stay in shape and be mature and be sure to complement a man's life.Guys want a girl? Stay in shape and prove you have something going on in life so you can be sure a compliment to a girls life.Key and common ingredient? Stay in shape... it shows you have self responsibility...Got on a little tangent but that's enough.
Hard work and self respect - take a good long look fatties.
She should probably lose some weight then :-)
Yes exactly. My place of employment has recently become a lot more anti-smoking and yet we have a few fat fucks who don't get shit done all day. A lot of shops have stopped carrying cigarettes and still carry disgusting fatty foods. Not trying to argue that smoking is healthy, or better... I do smoke but I know it's unhealthy and it shouldn't be as socially acceptable. But seeing as so many more people die from obesity related diseases, perhaps focus on that instead.

My guinea pig is furious now
lol exactly what i was thinking
"Im not hungry." Bullshit you fat cunt.
those are just some people she hired to feed her.
I used to work in an apartment office with a total of 5 employees. A good friend of mine and myself were up front as leasing agents and the others were all management. 2 were the size of Jupiter and ate worse than anyone I've ever seen. The other was also fat, but not even in the same league as the other two. They were easily 225+. But the third girl was trying to get her weight in check. This was the worst working environment for eating right I have EVER been in. It was a college complex, so the two fattys always set out snacks, pizza, candy, and all kinds of bull shit all over the office. Given this is all a matter of will power, but come on. Get the tootsie rolls off my fucking desk. My friend and I both would just brush off whatever the two fattys would throw at us about not eating everything in site. They would also literally rip apart (after they left) every skinny chick that came in the office. Calling them bitches, skanks, etc. Almost always we would defend said skinny hot chick. We re both guys so I honestly think there was a little bit of a crush thing going on or something. To go along with the pure jealousy. But the other girl, o God. She got so much shit from them. They would literally intentionally out vote her on where to go to lunch to try and impede her from getting something healthy. Finally one day she came to us and asked if we would get her back when they started shaming her for not getting on the fat train. You don't need to lose any weight... Blah blah blah. Same old shit we've all heard. So we did. We would jokingly / but not jokingly snap right back at them when they'd bitch at her. There was definitely some tension in the office for awhile. I mean these were our bosses. But through some tuff love from us and defending her from the jabas, she ended up losing about 30 pounds just in time for her wedding. But man, now that I look back it makes me furious. Those fat pieces of shit. My friend and I both left shortly after her wedding. I can only hope she hung in there. Extra fun note. We got in trouble a few weeks after we started working there because we drank all the office water. We literally went through the office's whole month supply of 5 gallon water jugs in about a week and a half. Because, Um, we actually drank water like normal humans. That's how gross these bitches were. Only sodas for them. We basically told them to fuck off and ordered more water ourselves. Later we were told to try and drink more out of the water fountain. Don't pay any attention to the stacks of cases of sodas in each office. Dumb gross bitches. God fat people are the worst.

My gym was empty all weekend. *It was glorious*. Never have I been able to fit so many exercises in for chest, back, and arms. **So much room for activities!**
the most obnoxious part of this whole 'body shaming' movement is that I guarantee you 100% of the people who rush in to go "omg i caught you body shaming! i win 10 internet points! maybe the internet cool-kids will like me now!" (i'm paraphrasing a bit) are all people who look at other ugly people and think in their heads "damn that person is fucking ugly!" (or something similar)it's damned hypocritical. they ~~are making~~ made the internet a place where you aren't allowed to say what you think.we're the ones who need 'safe spaces' now.

I'm more concerned about how they keep leaving the "-size" out of "super-size" model...
You'd be surprised. Lots of young girls are buying into this idea that losing weight is like admitting defeat because enacting self improvement requires you to give up the delusion that you're flawless and amazing and born a perfect beautiful woman, a mantra they they feed themselves and each other constantly to keep their feefees from running out of the external validation that keeps them from having total ego meltdowns.
There was definitely a time when fat people didn't exist. Back when humans were still hunter/gatherers not only did you have to actually physically exert yourself to get food, there just simply wasn't enough for anyone to gorge themselves on. If by some magical feat you managed to cram enough food into your body to get fat, other people would see this and probably kill you for hoarding resources. When it's survival of the fittest, bloated pieces of shit don't make the cut.
I love dill pickles. Perfect for salt cravings. I save the pickle juice and splash some of that in my eggs. And then grill up some pineapple for a really tangy, sweet breakfast.

One might wonder that they might already have life vests in "obese" size, though. But I don't get why her sons were so excited. They obviously see whales every day. Or at least one whale.

this exactly. man I'm not skinny nor am I ripped or anything, but anything below BMI 24 is too skinny and I "need to eat more".
Somewhat mobile but couldn't do many physical activites, such as hiking, riding a bike, etc.I am glad that I've seen the light. I wish fit guys would stop getting with hamplanets, so they stop feeling a sense of entitlement and that it is ok to be so fat!
Depends on the intensity / duration of the exercise. Tell Ironmen/women that staying slim is 80% diet.
huh. Thanks for the info, I was always told she put it on for that reason.
&gt; I feel like spanking wouldn't even hurt that much for a kinky ham because all the squishy flesh would absorb the blow.Yup. If you think about it we are born with a set amount of nerves in our body. You can grow more fat cells but not more nerves, so a larger area with the same amount of nerves will have less sensation.
Oh I like butter huffer.

To be clear. Depression is very real and I believe EVERYONE feels it. Therefore it cannot be a crutch

It's a cultural thing. In some black communities, being "thick" is celebrated, so there's less taboo in being overweight. Women also feel less need to be conventionally thin, since dating an overweight, "curvy" girl is far more normalized and less worthy of ridicule than in white culture.There also tends to be more poverty in black neighborhoods, so eating cheap, calorie dense, and unhealthy foods is pretty common. Parents could grow up in poor and maybe food-unstable food situations, which can lead to the "Starving Mother" phenomenon where parents over feed their kids to make sure they never go through the same experience.This is all conjecture. If I got something blatantly wrong, let me know.
Hampocalypse, wow.

Fat girls know they don't have much to offer physically and attempt to over compensate when it comes to finding a man. That being said one of the nicest girls I know is incredibly hot, has never been fat, and has modeled for playboy. Basically don't blame your own insecurities and some bad experiences to paint every fat girl as somehow "nice" and ever healthy girl as stuck up.

Except Marilyn Monroe was about a modern day size 0-2. Her dress wouldn't even fit on a mannequin. Don't know why the beasts have taken her over. She was very slender the majority of her life and only ballooned up to 140 after a miscarriage and in the depths of her depression/drugs. Not slim, but far from "fat"
Not sure whether "pure" water is actually tasteless, but water from a tap definitely has its own taste. You'll notice it very clearly when travelling between countries, sometimes between regions. It's really kind of 'iew' sometimes. I love the water here in the Netherlands, but if I'm not mistaken our tap water is the best (not sure if that means purest) in the world. Bottled water doesn't really have an obvious taste since they all tend to filter the water well, although I've never tried them side by side.

You have seen it. You cannot unsee it. It sucks but it truely is a public service. The Fats/ future fats need to see this .

They are ruining this activity, I hope yoga won't be the next "ham trend"
Holy shit that girl is on my newsfeed (the fat one)
So did the battery for the mobility scooter so she can't even go get more.
They probably have IRL Friends and don't require internet meet-ups to be social.
Yup, she pm'd several of us and since none of us validated her she sought it from others.
Yes, it is. The more cacao in it, the better!
I'm sorry you got beat up for being gay... something that you can't change, unlike these fucking whales everywhere who complain about their 'problems' when they can do something about them. You're rant is well deserved.
Does anybody notice the slob to the right of her looks almost petite in contrast. This phenomena needs a name.
If the fetish was tryin for was to induce vomit then she nailed it, fucking fat fuck almost made me lose my lunch.
And still call us shallow if we ever were to say antthing about preferences about their hair color, boob size, Waist size, weight etc
I apologize, my writing was filled with so much angry I didn't pay attention.
Jesus, fat floppy tits are so not what I want to have or look like.
Well, they do, it just isn't as drastic of a difference so it isn't really noticeable. But yes, figuring out maintenance calories should always take height and gender into account to be more accurate.All things being equal, shorter people have less lung capacity, less tissue to perfuse, less everything overall, and therefore need fewer calories to make it all work at a zero-sum.
This is by far the best title for any Reddit post I have ever seen. Flawless.
The funny thing is for the cost of that pizza, you could probably get two or three pounds of actual tomatoes, with all dat vitamin c and a and potassium... Not that a pig looking for slop cares.
It's for hooking up. Lots of girls say stuff like "not here to hookup!" which usually translates to "until I figure out if you're hot we're not gonna fuck".

yup. when i was in high school people would constantly be eating this during lunch. And they made fun of me for having a healthy lunch from home...
Ah, very true. I want to do an experiment, show people a 4 oz chicken thigh, a 6 oz, and an 8 oz, and ask them which one is 6 oz just to see how many people get it wrong.
OK you're boring me.
Warning for fat sympathy.
What in fucks name? I've seen some disgusting things but that...thing definitely takes the cake (and fucking demolishes it).
I dunno about America but here in Europe WoW's servers are full of normal people with full time jobs, a girlfriend/boyfriend/husband/wife a decent diet and lifestyle and no social awkwardness at all (I participated in at least two dozen IRL meetings and all of them were awesome parties in nightclubs/bars) We had one jobless guy in my guild (but he found a job like 2 weeks after I met him) and one obese guy (90kg) who had sort of an excuse since he was bound to a wheelchair for over a year and was 1.85m tall but as soon as he got the authorization to do sport again he started a diet. That's all in 10 years in the same guild. It's funny but most Europeans I meet on the internet seem like normal people while americans are often fat virgins who failed their university and are jobless, maybe it's because online gaming isn't seen as a bad thing over here so it's more widespread? The only wierd guys are the britishs but they are more like americans than europeans most of the time anyways.
You're dead if you crash. Full stop.
Good luck getting a forklift to handle on sand!
Her son is skinny because he has to push her fatass around all the time.
I guess when they have their Eat-A-Thons their brains release endorphins. Therefore they consume and are happy. Food is a drug to them they can never get enough. Im pretty sure you ask a fatty about what foods are their favorite they will go into a high detailed description.
Flaunt your wealth to strangers on the internet harder please.
Wrong, the threads they brigaded us from are VERY much sjw related. And yes, most of reddit does appear to be fat. Are we really surprised? They already outnumber us outside, it was bound to be even worse online, if you think about it:(
Elaborate please. Did she start growing hair on her face? Why did she wake up vomiting? This interests me.
It's not healthy to beat yourself up about a piece of cake. Think about in this context, if you've been faithfully putting away 15% of your check into savings every week, there's nothing wrong with splurging on that pair of shoes or a nice jacket even if you don't need them. Yeah, you shouldn't go out and buy a Maserati you can't afford, but if you're putting in the work, a treat is a treat.The group of guys I workout with all have days where we grab beers together or get some tacos. I have pizza every once and awhile, just had it for my nephew's birthday and had a little slice of cake too.Granted, I got full off of a few slices and a that cake, but there's nothing wrong with it. I had a couple of hard boiled eggs for breakfast that day and a small cucumber salad with some canned tuna on top and it all balanced out.Don't beat yourself up about it.
she looks old as hell for 19
We all have our vices... It's how we manage them that defines us. I may not understand your vice or theirs but I can see that you dealt with yours better than they have/are. Therefore, I respect you and I don't respect them.Don't let a way of describing something drive you from the sub. It's an inaccurate comparison. Plenty of other shitlords feel the same way, I'll try find a few of the posts for you.
You could say I......hate it.*YYYYYEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHH!*
I can't stop looking. The way the body moves is... unnatural. Like, it's not supposed to move like this but it does. It baffles my mind. This really is some nature documentary shit with Morgan Freeman narating.
I think she was just trying to tone down the shitlording.
Naah brah I already took my multiculturalism over to Canada, have plans to have kids with a white to destroy your precious white genome
Definitely take a look at some of the other flavors haha. Vanilla and Cherry Garcia are some of the lightest offenders. A pint like Chubby Hubby has over 1300 cal in it and you just *know* a fatty is going to go for something rich
It has to be more then that. Like 300kg.
Not really, it is really just a fact that around the world there are countries where women are treated like material objects rather than people still. Just look at the middle east or certain parts of India for example. These issues do certainly need looking at and fixing somehow, I do though agree with /u/kaiwanxiaode that it is rarely still happening in modern day america.
Sounds like America.
Lurking long enough to call for a specific mod to ban you...What, you keep getting banned on alternative accounts and want to collect all the mods catchphrases? And you think *we* are pathetic :D
Yeah, the red pill does have some very basic tips for self-improvement -- eat healthy and lift, be confident, dress well, don't worry so much about what others think -- but it's buried in so much misogyny (and often racism and homophobia, too) that it's like picking little kernels of corn out of a pile of shit.

I've seen so many comments on here consider this woman an "it". That is so freaking rude. You are not better than her because you don't weigh as much as her or have her body. She's a person that probably hates her body more than anything and could be depressed because of it. It could be a medical thing. Who knows. But whatever the reason, there's no need to degrade her so much as to call her an "it".
Figured she had nothing to lose, and decided to be the best at not looking very good by eating all of the food she could find.
So, all skinny people are imaginary.
Oh my god. It would be the single most disappointing burlesque show. "Aaaaaand for our final performer, the most talented, the most risque --- LADY GRAVY!"
She can't even duck face properly because her lips are sunken into her face from all the fat surrounding them.Thin privilege is being able to make a duck face.
I feel like starting an all ramen diet as a challenge.
It should be labeled: big boned only
Thanks. Great eye bleach.
Why bring bats? They could just stand on the scale to break them.
God, the husband and I made pact to not get fat ever, and to tell each other when we start to get out of shape. If you enjoy his hard body, don't you think he liked yours? Now you're fat and gross and you feel bad but want him to change his preferences instead of you changing your body.Good luck being single, you cow.
Caught them off guard with that one.
&gt; And kids were double dipping, and putting their fingers in it. All those germs being kept at incubator temperatures and mixed around!Yep! It looks delicious but I would *never* because ewwwww!

I thought this was actually the case.Time to google.First couple results seem to support this?
At least all those bathing suits cover their fupa's. Unlike that "bikini ready body" we saw yesterday where there was no way to confirm if she had bottoms on.
It's not, it's what she thinks dancer's hands should look like and she's way way off.
there needs to be some way to separate curvy from round
&gt;Once a picture is on the internet it doesn't belong to them anymore.Not even remotely close to how copyright law actually works.
What i don't understand is why fatties always do these courses, they somehow think it proves that they are fit or something.
"Shatter"...?No! They fucking *reinforce*.

I have MS and sometimes it's easier to get through my grocery shopping on one of these, but I can almost never get one since they are taken up by the fat creatures.
So he's on a 700 calories deficit just from his food intake, plus whatever he is losing at the gym, say another 500 calories, that's 1200 calories deficit a day.That, if true, is not healthy.Edit: 500 not 50
That took me a minute. I was all ready to defend my stupidity... But I get it.
I assume because he's fat and stupid, so double stupid.
I just realized why this argument against fat shaming pisses me off. Everything is socially constructed. Everything. You wearing clothes, having a job or not having one, how to treat people and how you want to be. Of course it's socially constructed. Everything is. Fat still isn't beautiful.
WHY does it think a tank-top is appropriate.In a restaurant at that. Cover the frak up, we're eating!She probably wants you to lose your appetite so she can eat all your food.
I bet you like vagina homo
I live in Ireland and until now I didn't know of this place, will definitely give them business of some sort or other.
No.
I can't imagine how much more I'd hate hams if I had ever worked in the food service industry. That's like being on the frontlines, man. I bet you've seen some shit.
Just the occasional fatty I can understand, but multiple people in the supermarket at the same time using those weird scooter things... Boggles my mind.
Not eating the day of a big meal is unhealthy? You should probably do some reading there. That sounds like some fucking FatLogic if I ever heard it. On top of that, intermittent fasting is a perfectly acceptable form of eating.
I see fat John Lennon

It's okay, I don't think I came up with it on my own anyways. Pretty sure a comedian said it at some point.

Pressing the pedal down to drive requires too much effort. She needs to be driven around to save her poor wittle fee fees.
It's not true in America, either. Prices shown here are bullshit.
That 200 calories has diminishing returns though.Eventually she's burning enough extra calories that that's just maintaining. The kind of weight gain we got here is serious fucking binging for 2 years straight.
LOL! Me too! I wish that I had told her about us! I bet her kid didn't gain the Freshman 15 in university. Imagine if they did?
They really don't get it. Half the shit they eat I wouldn't eat even if it had zero calories, it's absolute shite
Sorry about your mom. I'm glad you got your life back! She'd high five you for that I'm sure. No parent wants to see their child fail and you have done well.
Penn actually lost a lot of weight recently! There was a photo of him posted here a while ago, and he's really slimmed down.
I'm jealous of his beard though. I can't grow one. Its the classic "wanting what you can't have" thing.
Of course there has to be at least one bitch with colored hair. Always.
No, I wasn't embellishing at all. That particular location of the restaurant is next to a big highway construction zone, and I went at the time of evening where most of the workers had just gotten off their shift and came in to have shitty beers and be noisy. They legitimately did stink
Her calves are the size of my thighs and she has a McDonalds cup that looks like a small size because she's on a planetary scale.
It looks like her chair collapsed and she just said fuck it.Do they have to sit spread eagle all the time because their fat prevents them from putting their legs together?
Tess Monster's sister.
they wanna ruin their bodies, fuck em.
I know how fitness and calories work.Here, let me rephrase the question for you. My friend consumes more calories than he should be using every day since he eats so much sugar and is sedentary. How does he not put on weight and get fat?
haha love you
I think there are benches that have spikes which can be disabled when you put a coin in or whatever. Like, it has spikes, but you can pay $0.10 to remove the spikes for an hour, therein making it affordable, but impossible to sleep on for hours at a time. Also I am completely basing this off of some random thing I may have read or seen years ago and I don't know what I'm talking about.
Better question would be "why don't banana's spontaneously combust into purple fire?"
I'm amazed that there are men out there who are capable of getting these things pregnant. How can you even sustain an erection when one of these things takes their clothes off?

just for the record, p90x is legit as fuck. i lost around 60lbs in 2009 doing the 90-day program.all you have to do is want to lose weight. who knows what this thing wanted.
I took the train on the day of a Seahawks game, so I think I saw quite a few locals.
Especially considering the doctor probably said, "based on your BMI, you're a little overweight." Or "I would like to see you bring your weight down a little and see if that improves these other areas of your health." That doctor didn't tell anyone they're fat; that's just what the delusional bitch heard.
If it wasn't for the foot I wouldn't know what end was what, or even if it's human.
The scooby snacks were for the dog you fat piece of shit.
Well, if she falls on you, you just sue her and the company. I am pretty sure you can make a lot of cash. The only problem is, you will die a slow and painful death, because she can´t get up anymore if she fell.
Great, now I'm going to get nightmares tonight.
Well shit son. I don't think "impressed" is the right word but... A+ for you.
HOW IS HE/SHE GONNA BE ABLE TO HIDE NOW? I can see that thing from space.

How can someone let it get this bad? How is that even possible?! This is disgusting!
yep, same
I think I sense sarcasm.
Her complexion is just.... awful! Does she even exfoliate any of that grease off of her? I know some people can't help having acne, but I'm willing to bet that in her case if she were to put some effort (ie sweating, drinking water, exfoliating, etc) she could have a clean and clear complexion. But no, french fries are more important than protecting your beauty.
Super boring, ugly ass French manicures need to die. As does she.
Thank you, for giving me a reason to serve.

*Exactly.* What kind of yoga are these fatties doing? I could barely keep up with the instructor. I'm sweating, falling left and right, and by the end of the session, my version of down-ward facing dog is a dog with only two working limbs. Same shit going on in tai chi. I'm scared of fat fucks infiltrating this ancient art. But then again, fatties have no self control and patience. So far, I haven't seen any fatties in my practice. :3
YUP. I had a friend who would only message 10s even though she was a 4 (and took angled shots to look like an 8) and was mad that they only fucked her and never talked to her again. She also had two kids, one was only a year old, was on every kind of welfare and lived in a shit hole apartment. Yet she thought she was awesome and deserved a hot, well paid guy and couldn't understand why she didn't have one. She doesn't talk to me because I pointed out that she wouldn't date anyone in her situation. That made me "toxic" to her.
Fupa inception
To be fair, everything around her is pretty thick
omg. WHAT IS IT?!
Looks like scabies, probably from spending too much time in plus size clothing stores.

She'd be better off slinging a sack of potatoes over her shoulder and walking until she looks athletic.
Looks like the overweight turned into obese.This is terrible news.
I work private catering for a number of different wineries and chefs nearby SF, CA. Lots of business and sales meetings with some really rich, powerful people and I've never seen an obeast guest. There's a couple guys with slight beer bellies but the rest are overwhelming in good if not great shape. I've never seen a fat woman at one.All the tasting room people are slim and well put together as well. Fatties, if there are any, tend to work in the back offices where they can't be seen. Same with servers. We don't hire fat people because they get sweaty and tired/miserable looking really quickly, especially in summer. My boss once fired an event manager that would wear stilettos all the time but because she was a planet the strain on her body would pinch her face into a look of perpetual misery. She would teehee and laugh it off when others warned her that her shoes made her look like shit and would bite her in the ass. Was so happy to see her go. Cunt always made me run around doing half her job for her because her fat ass couldn't walk period let alone on gravel in stilettos.A guy I used to work for/with opened his own restaurant and part of the interview process was making sure you could easily walk between the tables without disturbing patrons. I'm moving soon and I really hope the restaurant/fine dining folk in Oregon are as shitlordy as they are here.
Nothing is great about being fat!!!! You know what is great visible abs!!!! Being able to see your junk when you piss.
I think even if I hit them with my tank I'd have to replace a couple of road wheels and we'd probably throw track.
Dunkin donuts decided the regular amount of cream and sugar wasn't enough, so they blend a minuscule amount of coffee with tons of it and ice to make a frozen drink the ham planets go crazy for.

I assume this is why they waddle and not walk. The last cry of the body before it REALLY starts to give out and give up doing normal human things.

I don't think Peppermint Butler is a ham, he has skinny arms and legs. He doesn't seem overweight at all for a peppermint candy drop person. He moves around pretty quick and his occupation has him on his feet all the time. Personally I don't view Satanism as inherently evil. I also agree about Ice King. I sort of filed him under evil because he's a main antagonistWhat alignment do you think those [creepy nurses](URL

Fat people think they're Captain Kirk tryna beat the *Kobayashi Maru.*
This reminds me of that "My Immortal" epitome of godawful Harry Potter fanfaction, where the main character is named Ebony Darkness Dementia Raven Way and goes on about how quirky she is and how much she loves Draco Malfoy. Then again, that's also the mentality of most fats.
Are you sure there's 15? Or did some of them get lost under all the fat rolls?
It's so fat even the fingers have rolls.

See, here's the thing I've been noticing recently. What's all this talk of "running away"? And it's not just you but I keep seeing it all over this sub. Is it to show we have superior athleticism? Because that's obvious as shit. We crack the one liners and what are they gonna do? Eat us? Oh boo how we hurt your fee fees. But seriously fat whales ain't gonna do shit. So crack those one liners and stay put.

*FAT LOGIC*
Yeah, I can guarantee you she was bigger than 230 lbs. I've heard enough horror stories of guys meeting someone they met on a dating site and finding out they were using an old photo from before they put on even more weight.
Sorry to hear.Re : your flair, my clock only goes from 1 to 12 : (
Wow, she sure takes back fat to the next level
Imagine when she has to take a constipated shit? I bet her head swells to 3x the size.
What a little brat. What did we learn? You can't be nice to fat people, not even once. *sigh*
If she spent the time, money, and energy that she spends doing makeup on eating right and exercise, she wouldn't even need makeup....Not that it's actually helping.
You don't know how bad I wanna run up to a fat on a scootypuff now and wack them up the side of their globby head and walk, not run, away. It would be too easy.
I'm going to lose weightLosing weight is hardIts easier to not lose weightI'm going to convince myself that everything is fine instead of losing weight. Women prefer fat guysI'm a fat guyEverything is great. No need to lose weight.
Her eyebrows look just fine, and she looks fine.
This shouldn't be ok. Now we need a scale (ha) for levels of fat? Makes me want to never eat again.
Remember that soda doesn't count. You gotta hydrate.
Her head/face looks like it belongs in a children's book. The woman in the moon.
Yeah, as someone in the field of genetics that is *udder* rubbish. Genes cant make you an obese cow. And fat eats your brain away and replaces it with more fat, which is what we in the scientific community call a "Faticus retardicus", colloquially known as a "fatty fat fat".
Oh, that makes sense. the infamous angle deception
when i first heard of hot topic, i was in florida, so i already associated it with fat goth girls. not that there's anything wrong with a heathy goth (um, not to be confused with 'health goth'. god life is so complicated now).
Banned.
People severely underestimate the food they eat. When they don't lose weight, they can't accept that they're counting wrong so they blame their metabolism or thyroid, not knowing what the former even is or how the latter even works.
&gt; "As long as he comes back to me, I could care less who he fucks. They get him for a night, I get him for life."That is sad. Your self esteem must be in the negatives if you're making excuses like that.
That is absolutely **disgusting**.
No way is he coming near me
We could start a thieves guild of shitlord gray foxes.
I think the heavy pic was from when he played Elvis incognito for the movie Bubba Hotep. Great fucking movie.
How can you tell if a fat person was on the sidewalk? By the footprints.
I too saw the pic and she definitely looks underweight. And she admitted to it. We would shame someone here for being 4 points above healthy on bmi, 4 points under is bad too.Just checked to verify and it is considered “severely underweight”.
Wait, did he go to the gym while he was bulking?
Oh don't worry we use romaine lettuce, its way healthier /s
cool, no hard feelings; I understand where you're coming from :) I didn't think about it this way either until my friend got gastric bypass surgery and she finally had the courage to talk openly about her struggles. I'm still sad that she felt like surgery was necessary to fix the problem, but I don't disagree that her being able to perceive it as a "medical problem" rather than a "character flaw" really made all the difference in her finding the resolve and support needed to finally overcome the issue.
Agree but its the worst candy. Tastes like cardboard.
I'd bleach the shit out of the counter if that, that thing, touched it.
AROOOOO I SMELL SUM TWINKIES LET THE HUNT BEGIN
As long as you eat fewer calories than you burn, you WILL lose weight. Your body cannot produce energy out of thin air.In my experience diet soda can give you quite the sugar craving though, which obviously isn't good at all for weak-willed fat fucks.
Have you ever been between a ham and her food trough? Fuck yeah they are powerful; all that weight moving at any speed has the power to push aside anything.
Typical, nothing changed. Its stomach looks like it just got more wrinkly.
That might be because you are disgusting and immense.
Because she wants treated the same way. She once made the joke that if she lost a limb because of beetus (that she doesn't have yet), then she would tell people she lost it in "Nom." She wonders why I never asked her to babysit.
A calorie is a calorie, it does not matter where it comes from. All foods are not equal in terms of nutritional value though. You aren't going to be very healthy if you eat 1500 calories of greasy mcdonalds on a daily basis compared to 1500 calories of a well balanced, non-processed diet. You might not be fat since you're only consuming 1500 a day but there's no way you're healthy.
Oh my god so much truth.The difference between actual confidence and narcissism.
No, that's not true. Men are very important to modern feminism, though you wouldn't see that if Tumblr and Reddit is your only experience of modern feminism.
I'll never understand how hambeasts are able to count as fucking handicapped. If you lose a leg, you're handicapped. If you're blind, you're handicapped. Being fat is not a handicap, it's a life choice.
You mean sideways, right?^(We meet again, old friend...)
The sausage fingers are a giveaway.
Sawgrass is in Florida.
wtf is authoritynutrition.com?[found the article](URLI think the word overweight is kind of key here. Overweight is not obese. Neither are good but if you have to choose, being overweight is the lesser of two evils, so to speak.
Surprisingly neither her nor her kids are fat at all. They are on welfare though.
No
There's no potential. She'd be a disgusting gollum faced sack of greasy wrinkled flapping dough. Politely go fuck off now.
I feel so bad for a man who has to take pills just to get it up so her fat ass can get off. Gross, sad, pathetic.
Your three-year-old daughter is not a vegan; you're just feeding her vegan food. Forcing a highly restrictive diet according to fringe food beliefs on children is likely to create conflict and acrimony when they realize that the forbidden food is delicious, almost everyone else is allowed to eat it, and not even health authorities say it's bad for them. There isn't even the threat of eternal torment and ostracism that religious food restrictions have.
"Be direct" LOL, coming from fatties that call themselves "curvy".
Uhhhh must be nice. I still struggle with my balance. Sad but true. I used to do ballroom dancing so my physical therapists thought I was a gymnast based on my posture but alas... I wish I could train high might make it a bit more fun. I just roll on my C4 crack. Never blazed on a pre-workout, wonder what that feels like
Mmmm, I love sliced parmesan in the morning! ^^^^*gag*
Maybe screenshots?
She's probably the hottest woman in Cleveland.
If you remove the letter K from "take walks" and then turn the words around, it becomes "eat slaw," which I believe is what she means.
Must be the high acid content throwing your body PH out of whack. Saw it on dr oz.
This is what I ment when I said earlyr that this smoker hate could decide the sub....
I think he looks like a fat Angry Videogame Nerd.
That is really up in the air, if it takes bottles upon bottles of embalming fluid to do the job I myself have charged just a little extra for the cost of additional materials but not labor just to be fair. Embalming its self usually is a flat rate price, but if we have to embalm Mt. Adipose it is going to take waaaaay more fluid than normal and much more time.
Your char makes me feel bad about your looks IRL.That's the type of face full of features I imagine a sociopath would make for his ideal self.
Most likely the origin of many people's deep fear of clowns is from the Bloatzo.
You're missing a couple of pluses there.
I did notice and see proof of the receding and balding hairline.
Oh and wtf is "sleep apnoea"? Is this new illness that only true women have and skinny whores can't get?
Does anybody else have just a small stomach where this amount of food would just be impossible to eat. Shit, I get full after eating half a sandwich I couldn't imagine eating a breakfast sandwich and then gobbling down an extra large drink holy fuck.
We're not buying, but renting it. It is awesome! 5 stories, it's also 500 feet from a lake, score!
That didn't sound like a neckbeard at all
Last time I was at McDiabetus, I sat on the edge of the seat just so that I can rest my elbows on the table. I'm 6ft tall btw.
We caught the hamburglar!No Fuck that, she's big enough to be a fridgeburglar
&gt; We need more old school military leaders and motivational tacticsSo what you're saying is we should dig up William Fairbairn and Chesty Puller and revive them?I like this idea.
I don't think she was particularly fit in 2006. Certainly landwhale on second picture. From there it's like she's just seeing how deep the rabbit hole goes.
Yeah so is sam and so am I and you play dota so....
While not a school, I had to quit my gym and go to a different one when the instructor and manager was clearly obese.Try spinning when a huge pile of lard is wobbling away on the front bike... ಠ_ಠ
I'll check em out
Having to be turned on in order to have a wet crotch.
&gt;"oddly shaped"Ok... Wonder what kind of shape... Hey, sometimes people are pear or apple or refrigerator-shaped. It can be tough to find good clothes. Or maybe you're swole and can't fit into skinnyfat clothes easily. I'm understanding.&gt;suggested maternity wearOh. So just a fat fuck with a massive protruding belly. Why didn't she say so to begin with?TIL that "oddly shaped" is the new code word for morbid obesity.
What is this? A chair for ants?
Sorry, I don't get it :c
Welfare checks have taxes drawn out of them. Kinda fucked up if you think about it--double-dipping, much like taxing military pay. That said, the morbidly obese should not qualify for welfare. If you're that overweight, you're getting your basic necessities somehow.
Exactly
If I just read this without seeing the picture, I would immediately ask if she was fat. It's like when someone describes someone to you and won't answer if they are good looking but say they're "nice" and "totally fun to hang out with".
Damned bloatware!
Wow, look at those scowls. I've always wondered if they were always just unhappy, or if their smiling muscles can't work with that much cheek weight. Even the fatties at chinese buffets always wear those scowls, and they should be having one of the best days of their life.
I guess bondage would be under bdsm, so I'm only kind weird.Fair enough.
How do you do that? I wanna be a verified shitlord.
I bet if you said this to a sjw their brain would explode.
Omg I love tubblr. Can we get that printed on t-shirts?
She had to be like 300+ pounds in order to fit all of those gummy worms into her fat rolls
Aww fuck yeah, I'm excited. I'll be going to CC in Colorado Springs starting this next fall, after living in Switzerland. Looks like I'll be able to avoid fat America for the most part.
I still feel like this is one of funniest things they've ever done, maybe even better than Paradigm Shift. I just don't know why it's not as accessible to people. When did the internet stop liking handicapped sex, man-on-man facials, and entrail-hanging?
the fuck did I just read?"I can't get a significant other because I'm fat and too worthless to do something about it. Better make up a relationship with two equally worthless pieces of shit because its edgy to "love" a killer."
Enjoy my video :-)
I would have walked out as soon as I had seen her blobness. Had I stayed to go to dinner I would have nope'd her when she tried to order three meals. I also would have take the right turn, so at least you got that one right OP! Third time's the charm. By the way, what the fuck did you two even talk about over dinner? Curious to know what whales enjoy conversing about.
You're probably fine dude, I'm overweight according to BMI (6'1" @ 200 lbs) but am pic approved because I actually work out. Don't really have much to contribute since I live in one of the slimmest cities in the world so no flair for me yet :(
I think she misunderstood the meaning of *layering*.
Medical bills are expensive AF. Imagine how high his must've been with all his cundishuns!
No this is not my before photo. This is much, much worse.Also while you can eff my beautify standards all you want, you can't eff societies standards because it is the objective beauty standard and _words have meaning_.
Thats like saying "why dont Schizophrenic people notice that they're being crazy and use their common sense to stop being crazy!" Most weight problems are linked to psychological issues that need to be addressed before, during and after their diet/exercise plan so they can realize the extent of the damage they are doing to themselves.edit: a word.
Space Ninja got it.
20 pounds heavier than me and 9 inches shorter...lolwhat?
You don't seem to understand my point - there's 3 types of macro nutrients (I'm excluding booze). Protein, fat, carbs. You're getting 720 calories from protein and carbs which means the rest needed (Likely a minimum of 1500 calories if you're very inactive and very short) must come from fat.
Only featuring the face, too. Sadly, she didn't figure out how to do the fat girl angle shot.
I just always thought it was because they want to be the center of attention and have everyone cater to them. It's also a power issue, they want power over other people.
May I ask what you are working now ? There are fat people everywhere, it is very difficult to avoid them.
I got fooled by this once. A looooong time ago.. in the AOL chatroom days. Found a girl who was absolutely smoking hot and thin in pictures. Met up in person and she was a fucking gorilla. It was the same girl, they were just deceptive angles.Never meet someone from the interwebs without multiple body shots.
I wonder if she'll ever turn full hambeast? Maybe when people get tired of her "talent" and she only has food to comfort her. She's short enough to quickly become truly spherical.
It looks like she's falling down dramatically.
The numbers you are quoting are reported instances. I highly doubt the majority of binge eaters know they binge eat.
I was thinking about this last night. Between being overweight and obesity, they are the majority. So who is oppressing who? Eat uh cheesbooger! Hur hur hurBones are for dogs! Teehee

Only way she'll ever fly is with a seat belt extender while squishing whatever unfortunate soul gets stuck next to her.
She was sucking dick behind Home Depot to make ends meet.
Just don't post your routine on fitness.... Unless you use a set workout routine by one of their gods they will piss all over you. News flash: Any routine focused on compound freeweight movements will get results, given you eat right and sleep enough.
What the hell man.
I sure hope she is not a school librarian. Think of the children.
christ you fucking would believe in jesus
Reminds me of this URL
"every size except skinny"That's it. That's enough internet for me today.
But what about handicapped shitlords?
I've used that substitute before, it makes a nice dressing. I still don't like the flavor of ranch, but it's not bad at all. You can thin out tzatziki, I think that's tasty, too.
Ranch is the official condiment of the fatties
Did you not see those eyebrows?!
Sooooooo, increase your worth hams by losing some damn weight. It's as easy as pie . . . hey, where'd the pie go? Oh, never mind.
I know the voice is so manly
&gt; I don't live my life to please the other sex or compete with other girlsIt shows.
Maybe if it goes into a long diabetes-induced coma, but otherwise unlikely.
I'm not sure being overweight is equatable to being a murderer at all.. Think of it more like someone who smokes 20 cigs a day cutting down... Yeah they're not doing any better than the average person but they're doing a damn site better for themselves and that makes me feel happy for them.
It looks like Canada?
If fit girls started posting on there, I'd get a twitter account. Just sayin'.
'Butter' fly
That's cool, I'm just curious about where she's stated racist remarks. Mostly because she comes off as the "I love everyone" blonde bimbo, not the "kill fags and blacks" type
"Lame jokes?" I didn't see any lame jokes - just a stone cold obvious fact
It would take a decent amount of tofu. That said, back when I was poor and trying to eat protein, I would eat a whole block of tofu in a sitting, fried up in a little coconut oil and slathered in spices. It was good eats, but I feel like if I did it three times a day, I'd definitely be tipping over my TDEE.
There is settling down and then there is setting down your standards
I have another comment addressing this idea if you are interested.
Easily the WORST piercing of them all. Metal snot running out of your nose.
Did she leave him for a KFC restaurant?
According to TiTP, it is acceptable to make the thin person carry the weight of two heavy bags while standing up, but not acceptable to make the fat lady have to stand up (even though it takes less strength than carrying two heavy bags). What they want is fat privilege, Cartman-style. A fried chicken in every pot and a Rascal in every home.
Ahh, okay.
the beef he had with you omg you guys. so many puns on here and they aren't even intentional
I don't get it. Where was she getting the caramel coffee from?
You are seriously triggering me! Loseweightnothate
I'm in architecture, and in the California Builder's Code, currently the minimum size for egress (escape) windows in any type of living room (bedroom, office, etc.) is 5.7 sq. ft.At minimum, the window would have to be around 2.4 ft in width and height. No way a fatty would be able to get through it unless the window was decently large
I'm a thin-looking girl over 140 lbs. I'm also over 6 feet tall though. :(
Im a straight woman, but I would fucken turn gay for Jillian. She is amazing. Her mentality is just what makes her a good trainer, Ive had a few trainers over the years and the good ones are just like her, always pushing and expecting more from you. I would give anything to train with her.
My problem is my tendon doesn't track through my knee properly. I don't need to strengthen the bone or tendon. I need to avoid tearing it up from overuse.
They have two seasons of that show on Netflix instant. Thank you OP, thank you.
She's got those Lumpy Space Princess curves.
In all seriousness, though, does anyone know what shoes it's wearing? It's like florals from Shelly's and wedges from Jeffery Campbell made a love-child shoe. I need to see these on my normal-sized legs.

Fuck that. You didn't owe it to them to be attracted to them.
That is going to collapse a building somewhere from the shockwaves.
If you told me a fat entitled mother got kicked off a plane for being a cunt, this is exactly the person I would envision.
This is Penis Wizard's flag* *Apologies if this is already posted below
it's not her fault all the calories go right to her dairy air!
Looks like she weighs as much as the horse.
I dream about cooking/eating fairly often. I fast for the majority of the day, so that may be why (and hey, I love food. We have a healthy relationship). One time, though, while I was dating my now husband, I woke up and he'd made some eggs and toast and offered me some. While beginning to make myself some tea, I nonchalantly, as if it were totally normal and without thinking, replied "No thanks, I ate in my dream."Needless to say, it took a while to live that one down.
I agree. And whales are pretty fascinating creatures as well. They get such a bad rap here.
Love it when the hate from this sub is unleashed onto the Youtube comment section. Too many white knights and fat defenders out there. Surprsingly, I did not see the classic white knight top comment "the comment section disgusts me....I am depressed now... blah blah blah other peoples weight is not ur business... blah blah ... HAES".
Li'l Ceaser's fye dolla hot 'n ready y'all!!
The fuck's wrong with her face? Did she have a stroke?
As a fellow car enthusiast&gt;stickers on a carSmh
If her house caught fire she would never make it out in time.
Why not, she's smoking hot, runs her own business, and is married to the Greatest Rapper of All Time (not trolling, I'm Team Kanye, fight me m8)
trigggggggggggggered. better call papa johns and cry about it. :)
If theres fat like that, he's fat.I'm not saying you should be lean and &gt;10BF% year round, but he clearly doesent lift, so hes just fat
Of course, if they knew the moves this means that they've done them before and... just look at them
And I do see it that way, really. If you're fat, then you have some serious character flaws. That laziness, apathy, selfishness doesn't stay isolated to their lack of self-care, it permeates their entire personality and influences everything about their lives. This is where the whole "I'm not fat, I *have* fat" rhetoric fails.And not only that, take a look at fat blogs. Fat is their life. Not rock climbing, cycling, swimming, immersing yourself in a culture, innovation, none of that. Being fat is like being a social outcast in High School - all you are is a statement of 'edginess' and how oppressed you are. There's no personality or identity outside of their disgusting blubber.But fatties are a mental case on their own, really. Too many layers of idiocy in their psyche to fuck with.
Yeah.. I had 3 pieces of pizza and 4 vodka waters tonight and I'm not fat. Preach! :raising_hands:
Is it even a real hand? It's so misshaped and discolored it looks like a piece of plastic. How much do you have to eat for your body to look like that?
Hallelujah!
What the hell is "eis cream"?
Such edgy piercings!! She's so unique and different!!!!
I'm thinking one front view, on side view? Has to show stomach in at least one, neck in at least one?
"Please make it stop, I won't be a bad alligator again!"
She also has great fashion sense, wears Chanel, Christian Louboutin, Marc Jacobs, Zac Posen ect. Those are all shitlord brands... well, maybe except Marc Jacobs... he's vanity sizing is getting worse and worse in recent years.
Not enough alcohol in the world.
To be a dropout insinuates you at least were enrolled, more like diet industry reject
Obviously. But their parents could be obese and overfeed them. But yes all that sugar coursing through your veins isn't good for oxygen in blood and this brain. Plus doctors appointments for condishuns and beetus isn't conducive to academic studies and school attendance. Had a non-obese diabetic classmate that used to chuck a sickie in some classes he didn't like to go get a bottle of coke from vending machine. He'd take someone with him in case. It was great getting out of religious studies of a shitty wingnut teacher. Most of the time he faked the low sugar feeling.
WHY do they always look so CONFUSED!!!I swear 90% of the super obese that wheel around my store have this look on their face. Like someone just farted.Like their alzheimer just kicked in.Like everything is inconveniencing it.Like they just saw a mirror.
I actually did this when I was losing weight. Every pound I lost was added to a weighted vest that I used during cardio. The calf gainz were real.
Fatties need someone to stand up for them because they are too lazy to stand up for themselves.Edit: at all
God damn.152.4lbs, 5'7" and I have a 28" waist. Fucking lying cunt.
People in the area must feel so safe knowing that this fat asshole is going to "protect" them.
I think it's great that you used it for motivation and congrats on making the change! I respect fellow (actual) shitlords like you a lot.Looking back, I have never been fat but here even leaning a bit too close to the higher end of the healthy BMI is bad, so I have experienced shaming myself. Nothing that bad from an obeast, though. My patience doesn't extend that far. If my dad would have said something like that to me it would have probably escalated to an all out war, lol.
Hells yes, perfect. donthatetheshake
I suppose... but it's like she's trying, I think that's what's so annoying. She just looks like she smells like b.o. and cheese. That hair. Smh.
:D ...that's the jokeAlthough they could probably leg press a lot since they're effectively squatting like 100kg every time they stand up.
I mean I agree to an extent but 40 years ago this shit would not be tolerated. They're normalising this fucked up behaviour.
She ate a mattress...now, she looks like a mattress.
Can relate!I'm older than any of these hams will *ever* be and still *not one fucking cavity* (knock wood)!
No, but I saw that question coming. Because everyone knows the 1 way to deal with a disagreement is to attack the other person's character.
Rather have a shit load of loose skin and stretch marks then be that thing on the left. That's for sure.
One pound of muscle vs one pound of fat: URLEdit: the "chubby" one could be much taller than Tess
How do you fuck this thing? You obvs can't do doggy, you can't do missionary, and you can't do cowgirl unless you wish death. It's like trying to fuck a an exploding plastic glove filled with mayo, except it's four times your weight.
The only thing I'm mad about is that I can't wear this without feeling like a poser or something, yet.
lol what. She's got a spare tire, dude. She's not 110 unless she's 4'6".
Urgh. So tee-hee cutesy. So uh, I just put my hand down between my thigh and groin to see what could be so confusing...nope. Nobody could be so confused by my body. There are bones (tendons?) there clearly differentiating thigh from labia. Something tells me I'll be deleting this later...
she looks like a bag of milk

I'm male and always subtract 80% of my weight, cause hey, a guy's organs shouldn't count against him! Or balls!
Steel wire rope should do.
If liberals wanted equality, they wouldn't be clamoring for firefighters and the military to lower their standards for women, and they definitely wouldn't be clamoring for Stuyvesant High School to have affirmative action for non-Asian students. Deep down inside they *know* those groups are less capable, whereas their opponents want everyone to be treated equally.
Can I, as a skinny girl, do that? Because my size is becoming increasingly hard to find. also. Hand that to any average retail slave, and we will roll our eyes and toss it when you're gone.
There is nothing quite as funny as an attention-seeking suicidal hamplanet. WHY do they feel compelled to post this shit online if it is so fucking depressing to them (and the rest of us as well)
I have a set of them like that. I actually used a bunch of them as blankets once when I was moving and didn't want to unpack my comforter. Worked really well.
What do you think his belly feels like? Soft? I truly think it is past the point of being jiggly and plushy to touch. It's gotta be a solid mass of fat. Hard. Can't be squished. Probably super convenient for him though. Like a little, personal table built right on his torso!
Even her fupa has a mouth!
This is actually from months ago, me and my friend used to send them back and forth! I only found this subreddit reasonly and thought I'd upload them
People, don't downvote /u/ABadManComes.It's entirely possible to admire a given quality about a person without admiring the person themselves.Take Hitler, for instance. Piece of shit human being, but you have to admit he was a brilliant orator and shit-stirrer.

Oh god, she looks like she is trying to squeeze out a giant shit.
Fupas will never be attractive.
Can you take in a t-shirt? I have a vintage Socks "America's First Cat" inauguration t-shirt from 1993, but it's XL and like a tent. I'd really like to wear it.
The drink is better.
Who wants to bet that the producers secretly hope she dies while the camera is filming her being "fabolous". Not that it would be a great loss if it did happen, the producers get their shock ratings and people get to see the consequences of being a ham.
your such a shit lady, life gets in the way with my genetic condishuns, and I can't help it, I *have* to eat 9k calories a day, and I have this rare but totally legit allergy to the gym. But I don't think I should have to settle for a girl my own weight, choosybeggars I want you!!!rofl I bet they post a whiny status about you on facebook too, saying how they were "totally nice" and she "such a bitch". Shitlord on!
I agree this is worse than the "Calling hams 'whales' is offensive to real whales" post. I'm never going to complement a fat face of being Blastoise-swole. This shit should have been dragonite.
Fuck off TRP scum
Anglo thing?
Keep up the good work shit lord.
Exception proves the rule.
Seriously though. I wish more people would call out fat people on their shit. And all their fucking ridiculous excuses and condishuns.Chicken and cream cheese sushi is not actually sushi.
I'm disgusted at the fact she tried it on without keeping her undergarments on (at least from what it looks like.) fat or not, that shits disgusting... Hopefully she bought that after her lard ass put it on and got mayo sweat all over it... Gross
On ANTM, there was this girl with G sized breasts. She was pretty thin and could fit into all of the clothes that they gave her. Her name was Esther Petrack.
Best. Comment. Ever.
He used to get really quiet and seemed slightly uncomfortable when I said anything. Not anymore.
Well at least shitlord friend asked fatty to come along and taste the food. Then again, I can see how it went. Shitlord: "Hey fatty, let's flip over our cards and see what our favorite three cakes are out of ten."Fatty: [nervously looks at ten cards that all say "EHRMAGOD!!!!!"] "Um, I can't really remember. I think I mixed some up. Maybe we can try them again?!"
What. The. Fuck.Ladies and gentleshits, obesity."Health at Every Size"Yes, and *this is what your health looks like* if your *size* is "*morbid obesity.*"
Why do they always pose like 3-year-olds?

I don't know, you see a clearly, mentally ill person, and the first thing you gotta do is start photographing him so that you can get some internet points ?
You're turning violet, violet!
No the hell it's not.
I work in the ER. Fat people put a huge strain on our resources because it requires multiple people to roll their fat asses around.
I know you mean well, but I really don't like when I see "people don't choose to be -race,gender,sexual orientation- but people choose to be fatThey don't.Even if people did choose to be whatever race gender whatever they shouldn't be subject to ridicule.Maybe I just overthink this stuff (*^_^*)
Oh don't worry, I don't. Heh heh
Ok im trying to picture the order of events.Sits/falls onto the toilet seat, commences his dump, short t-rex arms pull off one big length of toilet paper, reaches around his ham- panting*, tucks his fingers and a scrunch of TP into his canyon crack -fingertips hardly reaching anywhere near his asshole, thinks he's done his first wipe then grabs the TP again and repeats, all of this is a guessing game as he cant see past his ham. He thinks he is done after a second wipe but his damp cheeks hold on to that length of TP and as he rises slowly from the seat he struggles to pull up his zzzxxxl pants he is now the owner of a shit roll tale, all of his shit marked paper still hidden within the depths of his ass crevice. Waddling off with a trophy on show for all to see.
That's more than me as a 5'11" semi swole male. Kid could still afford to drop a few pounds as it is.
Amen!
It appears that the posts are simply links to twitter.
I can't even word.
My feefees waahh
I wanna see too!!!
That thing in her hand looks very much like a glucometer. Diabetic and eating/drinking all that shit. Unfuckingbelievable.
Uff, 15 minutes ?I would be completely cooled off &gt;.&lt;
I actually wouldn't mind if this dad bod thing took off. I mean more women for the shit load dudes, right! Before anyone chimes in about personality and confidence being just as or more important than looks, go ahead and visualize these dad bods combined with a tumblerina mentality transposed to guys.
A lot of these look more like sexual assaults than voluntary. And most of the voluntary ones look drunk. Rape and drugs that how fat girls get laid.
Also when they say, as a warning, that we are a "hate group". No shit sherlock
May your inner Samurai Ninja Shine, and may you bask in the glow of 400 harem anime DVDs.
Do I belong here if I have the body of that ginger bearded guy standing next to the black guy? I feel like I might be pushing it.
fatties are just terrible people. they exhibit jealousy, greed, stupidity, etc. just look at her face.
There are excellent curators that almost exclusively post on tumblr, it's easier than mindless surfing the web.
My martials arts school started black belt graduation with a 5 mile run around the park at 5am. I thought that place sucked when I was younger, but now I think it was awesome.
I love Disney and I think the same thing all the time. I guess they enjoy scooting from food place to food place??
I'm not fat nor have I ever been close to it but I can handle almost an entire pizza if not the whole thing by myself. Just started calorie counting though, so now I'll feel guilty.
Let's be honest, I'd be ok with being able to squat her body weight
Hi other bipolar person! Doesn't it suck when fatties use bipolar/depression/schizophrenia as an excuse? Now everyone thinks we are presuois little darlings and need an internet safe place or some shit. In reality my life has been fucking weird for a long time but I'm not fat
think of it this way... they are lucky they don't know for a fact that it is true.

These photo sets are like watching a train wreck, with the eye bleach at the end acting as proxy for rescuers pulling survivors from the train.
Thats not possible, guys...is it?
These people identify so much with their fatness since it has become their identity within their social circle. Losing the fat means losing their identity, atleast that's their mindset. So they'll go against anything and anyone just to stay the way they are, whether it's science, logic or anyone with a brain.
I think there are enough of these post floating around. Mods should start trimming them.
This is hilarious, this might be first time that I honestly bursted out laughing while reading something on this sub. It actually made me think I was going insane while reading it, fucking hamplanets.
They made a with through the GeneticsGenie and woke up like that
Seriously. The whole reason for him being so fat was originally to make fun of all the horrible sitcoms where the fat piece of shit has a ludicrously fit, sexy wife. It's a joke in and of itself.
What exactly is catfishing?
Right! I had to read it again because it was so good.
Do you know what tastes better than a burger? Having a body that is up for any of the little challenges everyday life throws at you. Imagine you're late for a train. You *run* up some flight of stairs, draw a short, sharp breath and *sprint* to the platform, jumping in the train as the doors are already closing. Of all the passengers, you were *the only one* who got that train. It's *that* smile that tastes better than any burger.(You, on the other hand, would probably realize that it is too fucking late to get the train, wheeze up the stairs and console yourself with a McBeetus meal while you wait for the next train.)

Again, yeah you're a racist fuck who's just as bad as the SJWs are.The irony here is that both you and the SJWs think you're somehow righteous in your viewpoints... which is why neither of you will ever succeed, and why you're both just two sides of the same coin.You both spawn from two sides of the same scum-filled, ignorance-driven, toxic waste filled pond.
Diana looks fat too.
Swimming instructor from a summer camp I used to go to as a kid. Oh my god she was HUGE. 350 lbs or so probably. I remember being super weirded out by her because of that.
I've noticed though that a lot of dudes with feeder fetishes tend to be really skinny guys. Don't know why.
is it rape if your own hand rejects you for being ugly and you force it anyway?
Aside from the way marginalized groups were treated, it was a great time (from what I hear)
Loot at that fucking pig, the dude likes his ham.
I don't understand it either. I always see landwhales wearing the smallest of cars here .
Probably this. She is probably either dying or decided she didn't want to die. Since he only wants someone totally dejected who hates themselves enough to slowly kill themselves, he is now on the prowl.

Of course. Because real women have curves and curves are sexy, remember?
Here's some feminism for you. You are just as stupid for destroying your body as a man of the same size. No discrimination here. You're all on a fast track to preventable disease and early death.
There's another difference between height preferences and weight preferences. Men who are short but otherwise reasonably attractive can usually find a short girl who is into them and who they find attractive. In other words, most short people don't find lack of height to be a disgusting turnoff in potential partners. With fat, it's a bit different: Most fat people are turned off or even revolted by other fat people. That's why so many fat girls hypocritically feel entitled to fit men. TLDR: Short people can be sexually attracted to other short people; fat people usually are not sexually attracted to other fat people.
It seems more like trading standards is investigating based on the claims the adverts are making. This is the quote from their preliminary report;"It's coming down in the next three days and, due to our concerns about a range of health and weight loss claims made in the ad, it can't appear again in its current form."
So...they sprinkle less sugar on their deep-fried dough? Eating healthy is too hard, even with a serious life-altering medical condition it seems.

Hating fats was once an acceptable open opinion to have and should have always been. I wouldn't be surprised if we reach 100k within the next month because I'm sure the majority of people are closeted shitlords. This is the only place for them to vent without repercussions. They just need to find us.
A pool of mountain dew is the most logical conclusion so far. Good guessing skills!

I am still trying to figure out why people this fat take pictures of themselves half clothed. It is in no way cute or sexy. Why don't they understand that?
Human form achieved, good job..
Hate it when fatties desecrate high quality fetishwear.

That's why I asked, it could go either way.
Clarifying it as "lacking imperfections...like a statute" the way he did doesn't make it any more sensible either.I can't stand Kate Upton and I blame her for a decent amount of the FA movement's delusion.
This fucking "top" comment though&gt;No one blames a woman who has one boob. Everyone blames the woman who has more than one number in her clothing size. We don't need to tell ourselves that we're beautiful. We need to tell the medical profession to stop giving the same advice on weight loss that hasn't worked for decades, or to STFU. 98% of the people who diet, gain back the weight, plus more. Get back to us when you have the answers.'The moment we stop eating properly and exercising, the weight comes back. You can't explain that. Checkmate medicine.'
Yours if the first post I've ever given gold to.Excellent idea. The airlines get sued ALL THE TIME for trying to get fat passenger to buy 2 seats. Even if it gets thrown out of court, it is a constant struggle. If they adopt your idea, they can avoid the lawsuits and maybe even make the fatties want to buy two seats in the future.I'd pay money to see all the fatties smooshed in like sardines.
One of my best friends suffers from schizophrenia. We were roommates once. He did indeed struggle with getting out of bed, leaving the house, and talking to people. Watching him suffer, trying to help, but ultimately realizing there was nothing I could do broke my heart. He is on meds now, doing better, but we don't talk much now.*FUCK* this fat thing for its whining and entitlement. It has *no idea* what real mental disabilities are. It ate itself into obesity and is now posting selfies in search of praise. Go to fucking hell, you pile of shit, and I hope you eat yourself to an early death.
yes, exactly! there's no magic in the birth control that'll make you balloon. besides the increased appetite, sometimes it can also occur water retention... which in real life, you know, won't ever make you put extra 50 lbs, lol. fret not, dear child, just keep on taking care of your body.
Hahaha butter gremlin. That's great!

Maybe it's just me but I want to know who "Rebel Alliance Man" is.Also looks like Wonder Woman ditched the Lasso of Truth for the Greasy Food of Weight Gain... okay sorry I'm not funny, but so far it looks like she's the only bad example there. Green Lantern looks like a powerlifter guy to me, and Spiderwoman just looks jacked.
Oh no, they know, and I tend to stay away from NSFW tags. They're shitlords like me. :D

That is the simple mindedness that all hambeasts have. I don't see the point about being friends with someone who have negative things to say about me when I am trying to better myself. It is just jealousy.
Antibiotics refer to anti-bacterial medications. I think the person was confusing antibiotics with a term to refer to medication in general.But you're right, for most people it's just an excuses. In the very small number of cases where weight gain is an actual side effect of a medication (which doesn't mean it is just because it said so on the information leaflet) it might cause at the very worst 10-15lbs. It's not an excuse for being 40, 50, 60, 100, 150, 200lbs+ overweight!
I am too fucking nice. Must shitlord harder.
I think it's the exact same thing. When unhealthy "cook books " are sold at a school, it's a literal endorsement of the foods in that book. The parents and the kids try those foods thinking that it's what they got at school so it must be okay. They might as well sell smokes at school, because sugar and fat are just as dangerous to kids as a pack of kools. Except that if someone tried to sell smokes as a fundraiser at an elementary school, people would rightly get in their faces and tell them how disgusting smoking is and how dangerous it is. Fat and sugar are the new smokes. Future generations will look at this the way we look at smoking ads on TV in the 1950s.

If she finds this thin representation of herself, she'll be masturbating to it until she drops dead. If she can still reach that area at this point.
I'm sorry to hear about your mother's suicide, OP. Just know that she never would have been the same after something that traumatic. Your real mother, the personality, died the moment she touched that thing. The hole I assume she blasted through her head during the massage just put her out of her misery.
THEYRE ONLY SAYING THAT COZ DOCTORS DONT UNDERSTAND FAT PEOPLE
I can relate to this. I was overweight once. I lost about 60 lbs simply by cutting out fast food and walking more. I never paid attention to calorie intake, I just made better decisions. So now when I see fat fucks, I just grimace at their laziness. It's honestly not that hard to lose wight if you put in effort.
I know, it's a shame. What I wouldn't give for a bdsm crowd that wasn't blob-shaped... It just takes all the fun out of it if there's no one attractive.

They already get that treatment. Their kids get more food at school lunches. They get government handouts for their cundishuns. Etc etc, they are very well versed at taking the cake.
Hagrid's daughter.
all good man... i think they should be forced to walk.... really disgusting how they just defend themselves by using the term "fat shame". Next meth addicts will claim discrimination for people calling them tweakers.
She should take more pictures of her feet. They're not going to be around much longer. She should preserve their memory before the beetus takes them away.
So does banning count as positive punishment then? Possibly also negative reinforcement - no health, no fph for you!
Girl is a pro who needs a lot more money for her time if that's the case.

Holy shit. Fuck planet fitness.

Making a face. Well fuck you planet fitness... Sorry for the rant but come on
Not to split hairs, but wasn't that Audrey II?
Indeed! At the most basic casual level of clothing: university t-shirt, some skinnies and flats can look absoloutely fucking adorable on a human but a ham will look utterly utterly frumpy and like they have put no effort. Fat just oozes ~~sweat puss and bad odour~~ laziness.Also....Sad statue of liberty, is that a S.O.A.D reference I see? :D
It's always okay to walk away. You don't owe anyone a date, and you don't owe it to them to try for even a single day.

This is true, and people with large noses. I have a large nose and surprise, it'll never be pierced.
Saw a fatty last night and I turned to my gf and said "Damn she wouldn't even look good if she was skinny, that is a bunk fucking face". Some people are just born destined to be hideous.
Post appeared on my wall, some lardbeast was called fat, so she made it an acronym for it.Went something on the lines ofShitlord "You look Fat"Fatty " Yeah I know I'm Fabulous And Tremendous"Is still the most cringeworthy thing I have ever seen.

It depends on how much smoke you're inadvertently inhaling, but typically, no. For all urine toxicology results, a certain amount of the metabolite must be detected for the test to be considered positive. Trace or scant amounts are not significant.

Ugh, lap band defeaters are the worst. The miracle of medical science has come up with a risky, drastic, invasive surgical procedure as a last ditch effort for when the rest of your weight loss efforts fail. They ~~push~~ roll you 90% of the way to the finish line, and you're so fucking lazy you won't even get up and walk the last few yards.
How can people live like this?
I have a BMI of 20 and would never in a million years feel comfortable doing this. I just don't know how they do it. Lack of self awareness is a terrifying thing.

Every family is different but most love each other unconditionally so in my opinion you can hate fat people and still love your family. My uncle was so fat he had type two diabetes and kidney issues along with urinary incontinence so he had to go on disability and he lost his house and then the whole family made huge sacrifices till the day he died walking from the car to the house after another hospital stay. We held a service, my aunt is the owner of his dog, my grandmother cried and said it should have been her, we even had an autopsy because the family was convinced the hospital shouldn't have discharged him. No one was mean enough to him, he wasn't using his catheters or watching his insulin and in one breath we would say he's a grown up who can make his own decisions and in the next we would discuss how to pay for this latest medical problem. The fat people in your family are the hardest to be mean to but they are the ones who need it the most not only because you want them to be around for a long time but because their fat effects you more than any strangers fat ever will.
Licking a stretch mark sounds like the worst fate imaginable. Like, Satan wouldn't wish that upon his greatest enemies.
How come she enabled her comments? Yesterday, it was disabled. Methinks this fatty is a total attention whore.
You may not be the fattest country, but you're one of the fattest ones.
It's like some of these women do everything to have a pretty face. That's good. Too bad they won't take care of the rest also.
They use a centrifuge (it's like that Gravitron ride at the fair...but small and for science) and it separates it out. I would imagine that different liquids have different times. My mom used to work in a lab at Duke University and would have to leave centrifuges overnight or something like that. Things may have changed since then though.
put that whale in a pool and have her kick the fat away?

Why would fat chicks even need sexy underwear, as if anyone is ever going see them in it. Fuck even if they did manage to sway some drunk gross dude with lack of self confidence to get into bed with them their rolls would most likely be swallowing the underwear anyways.

I like how this has happened a fair number of times to this pig, and yet she thinks everyone else is the problem. If you took the effort to not look like you swallowed a beach ball, maybe this wouldn't even be an issue.
Woah. I need to grab onto something. I feel dizzy from that delusional reality warp.Well this at least explains how *forcefully* I've been told by fatties over the years that my slim athletic build is because of metabolism, not diet and exercise. If I had to work for it it must not be privilege by definition, so fatties feel like giant losers standing next to me (like the girl in the sidebar). Reality warping to the rescue!Example: I *lurve* me some doughnuts. Haven't eaten a doughnut in years, maybe? Because I know that shit kills your fitness and health. Explain that, fattie. (also, enjoy your giant bag of doughnuts)
Fupa hoop

It probably just makes for more outrageous TV.Instead of sending the message to fatties that they can lose weight (that, as we know, most won't listen to), they're putting them on display so that normal people will go *WTF have you seen that shit*.More receptive viewers I guess? I don't have a problem with that actually; it still motivates me.
You mean Heilarious, get it right.
I know you're verified but this is pn the line to fat sympathy. She got herself fat as fuck and congratulating herself on doing close to nothing is not only delusional, but harms her willingness to go the gym and actually lose pounds
I'm sorry, that was hilarious. I have two cats and I will admit, I would probably do that. And they would come back for more because my cats love that shit.

Waist-to-hip ratio less than 1. On women .6-.7 is ideal; it corresponds to higher estrogen levels, higher fertility, and more intelligent offspring. The only positive thing high WHR corresponds to is youth. So it's only a good thing if you're a loli. So much for the "if you don't like my CURRVES and love handles you're either gay or a pedo!" argument; from an evopsych perspective, only a pedo could be attracted to said love handles.
What is it?
Well it might be a problem if they were actually people but they stopped being that years and hundreds of pounds ago.
Caloric absorption is not 100%. It's largely determined by which macro-nutrient it belongs to. Even then, external factors can influence this rate. The major one that comes to mind is amount of fiber in your diet. Outside of these factors, person to person there is little variation.
I try to separate internet and real life. Yes it can sting when someone says nasty shit online but you don't know them, you'll probably never meet them either.

sure fine, i'll just let people pillage and even rape me. surely that's okay, no one will be hurt that way. I don't even carry but I don't feel like it's okay to get away with a fucking crime just because someone wants something. if someone tries to legitimately hurt me, yes I would try to kill them because there's no physical way my 103 lb ass is going to get away from any sort of altercation of any kind.

None. We wouldn't go near them.
Pretty much that. But even they can lose weight, it is physically possible, if they're not constantly eating. The issue is that they are constantly feeling like they're starving to death, so they're constantly eating, regardless of what the item being put into their mouth is. But physically, calories in vs calories out still would take effect, if it could be put in place.There are NO genetic disorders or anything at all, actually, that causes calories in vs calories out to be false. In any form at all.
Thanks!

I was going to go on a mocking spree, but read some of the posts and felt sorry for some of the fuckers.Some of them need a slap, but some seem to have real anxiety issues. They need to realise that being with a girlfriend/boyfriend isn't the be all and end all of life. The more you hunt, the worse it gets.
Stretch marks are literally your body's way of saying: "woah fatty slow down with the food. I can't make new skin that quickly." The human body can send nerve impulses in milliseconds, it can regenerate torn muscle tissue, and make critical life saving decisions in the blink of an eye, yet as amazing as it is it can't make enough skin for these whales.
It's actually the other way around, sonic the protein was named after Sonic the Sega character. The hedgehog pathway was named earlier but the guy who found this protein in the pathway named it sonic because he saw his daughter reading a sonic comic and thought it would be funny.There's also proteins named after Dr eggman, C3PO, R2D2, scientists like to dick around too.

it would seem that she doesn't know sheeeooot about health. i.e. cholesterol management, proper diet, exercise. But she probably had first-hand experience with gastric-bypass surgery. So she's got that going for her, which is nice.

Listen, there were probably other reasons the recruiter didn't want to work to make exceptions for you.
There's a blind guy in my class. He's about 20 years old, weighs at least 350lb.
I can see myself joining it for like two classes if that'd make the fatties feel bad about themselves.
I was not. The admins could see these posts and claim we're brigading, even though we didn't link. We're about to hit 100k, and I'm sure they want us gone. Gotta be extra careful.
Gahhh! the all too frequent dreaded bread dough gut.

Guys don't minimize the problems of fit girls. They have to deal with things like men being attracted to them, fitting in things that are human-shaped, living to a ripe old age, wiping their own ass, and other terrible daily issues.
That's cartilage. That's what makes up fupas and necktits, as well.
Why do fat guys always have gynecomastia? And don't try to tell me that's all adipose tissue.
Just gave me an idea! My SO loves grinding but when she does it for really long it starts to hurt my pelvic bones just a teeny bit. So now I can make a 1" high medium density foam donut and slice in half and use magnets or Velcro to secure it around the base of my cock.
I think it's photoshop tbh
I'd just keep on messaging them every day. It's freaking reddit, I'll just make a new account.

To be fair she is reviewing mazapan not marzipan, which is the latin american version and is usually made of peanuts. It has its origin due to the fact that the spanish colonies in the americas did not produce almonds, but plenty of peanuts making for a palatable adaptation. Edit: grammar

Did you mean to post this to /r/thathappened?
Haha I love the goth scene. That photo is hilariously awesome. It looked more from 2000, than 2010 though. At least your dodged a fat bullet there.
Not only that. Feelings are subjective regarding speech. If those rules were taken seriously then you can't say anything anymore because there will always be someone who has their feelings hurt. Like you said: a thought police will take over and public debate is reduced to circle jerking in favor of the thought police. As it already is in Europe...
Ah, going for that "hobo that found a discarded evening dress" effect. Not the most flattering of looks.
Ugh I ate a bunch of this type of shit this weekend. Like 3 oatmeal cream pies and a couple swiss cake rolls. I was out in the woods all day and that was all my buddy brought to eat. Went for a run the next day and I felt like straight up garbage. Pace was way off, sweating like crazy, just a struggle to do what should have been the easiest run of the week.
No. That entire and movement is toxic.

it's ok, her heart rate was only up for a *few minutes* afterwards (according to her post)Seriously WTF. How bad of shape do you have to be in that climbing 3 flights of stairs takes a few minutes, and then it elevates your heart rate for a few minutes afterwards. I walk up 6+ flights of stairs *every single day* and I don't even notice it because it has no effect on my breathing or heart rate
Victim complex. Necktits. Dyed hair stupid colour. Bright lipstick. Piercings. Shitty glasses. Shitty eyebrows. Fatter than a whale on a bulk. Crappy tattoos. Ha, a fucking beard of hormonal cluster-fuckery. Several chins drooping to the sternum. OH MY GOD STOP EATING FOR SIX MONTHS! Give your hormones and stomach time to return to normal. You're fucking laughable.
| I hope that in the future, scientists will **shape up**Wow. Did she really just say that?As she is unwilling to change her fat ways and expects the world to tip-toe around her fat-princess-emotions, it's actually better for everyone that she not go into science.Generally, and in the majority, the scientific community as she herself says is extremely competitive. That alone means you need to grow some thick skin, and get competitive yourself. If your fat-buttons are too easily pushed, either thicken your emotional skin **to match physical fattiness** or eat less, eat healthier, do more....but we already know which choice fatty made, and which choices fatty will continue to make. All hail victim-fatty!
But, but how else will they feel like victims?!
I work in a very popular clothing store, it actually makes me sad to see only 1 XS come in a shipment of shirts, the funny thing is, the other day we got our first 4XL in. It looks like a fucking bedsheet spread out.
The shirt is funny and though I'm honestly not certain she looks pretty hot. Thanks for posting?
Don't you smear dirt on the good name of sloths. Fucking sick motherfuckers.
Hey! She's wearing a sweatband and joggers, she's clearly tired after a hard workout.Or more likely she's just tired after eating 5 Big Macs.
Seems more like a tee-hee totter if anything.
It doesn't really. But there is so much bad shit in there contributing to her horrible health on other ways. Plus if somebody is willing to drink that much diet soda, you can pretty much assume they are making all around bad health choices.
At least the fatties take all the sleezy-looking guys.
Beans are legumes, potatoes are not. Potatoes are tubers.
That must be it.
I have to wear khakis to work, and around that time, I'm so damn self conscious about it. How does she not feel that!?
yeah for women so "secure" they sure like to cake on the makeup. they'll embrace the flaws of their grotesque body, but not their blemished face.

I wanna know why too, is it an accent thing or what?
You're actually both right: on her right arm (left side) she has a band, and on the other arm she doesn't and still has a fold, though it doesn't go all the way around.
&gt; Wait how can people tell what subs we even just click on and view.They can't. OP commented in that thread, so it showed up in her comment history.

There is in some. I had excellent health classes that covered sex ed and proper exercise and a healthy diet. We had good PE classes every year and they offered healthy options for lunch as well as junk. This was in the southern United States too. It's been there, please stop blaming the schools. It falls on the parents who raise the generations of future fatties.
Gross
Exactly this. I'd challenge her to prove that someone obese (and not a swole bodybuilder bulk obese, but a real obese) could do parkour better than any of us.

I've wanted to be a redhead since I was a kid. But I was born with white hair. It turned golden blonde and now at nearly 25 it's become a dark dishwater blonde. I tried dying it red once but it was all fucked up. Still wish I had long auburn ringlets though. Or even the bright ginger color. They're all awesome.
URLThat's what I saw in my head based on your description.
That's disgusting. My grandma has smaller arm flab than that and she's 85
I honestly don't know, and frankly, don't care.
It makes me laugh how nice the picture is otherwise. The shallow depth of field, the shining wet pavement, the luminous colors, and then the lard.
I've never been able to understand this, even when I've had to eat large amounts. For example, [this is a training ride from last week](URLDon't get me wrong I like my food, but being faced with the task of having to eat 5,000 calories (over two days worth of food) after getting off the bike just doesn't do it for me. Even carb loading the night before, there's till over 3,000 calories in deficit. The amount of food, the bulk of it, the fact my stomach is used to normal portion sizes.......... I get to the point where I've had my fill but can still be more than a full days worth of food down. Even constantly grazing on food the rest of the evening, I can still go into the next day with a deficit when I want to have a surplus to ride again.In "My 600lb life" and all the other obesity programs which say they eat 5-6k calories *a day* with very little exercise, that has to be a noticeable amount of food. Even if you're consuming three fast food meals a day, that's going to be around 4,000 calories per day plus snacks. What a lot of people are oblivious to is just how loaded their foods are and how little they actually need for their lifestyles so shoot straight past their quota. And once it becomes habitual (morning sausage roll because that's what you always do.......) then the calories and fat quickly builds up.In sports (cycling) there is the philosophy of marginal gains. If I improve in 5 areas by 0.5% this week, by the end of the week I will be 2.5% better than the start of the week. If I keep adding 0.5% across 5 areas for a month, I can be 10% better by the end of the month. Equally, if I slack off and loose 0.5% on those 5 areas this week, I have to improve all 5 areas by 1% the next week *just* to get back on track, which is a much harder task. These fatties are the same;&gt; Monday - I want my beach body by June, so I need to cut out 200 calories per day to lose 1400 calories per week, but I've just eaten a sausage roll. Oh well, I'll double my efforts tomorrow (Running total: +200 calories)&gt; Tuesday - I wont eat todays sausage roll, haven't I done well! (But you're still not combatting yesterdays sausage roll, +200 calories)&gt; Wednesday - I've had a bad day. I won't have a sausage roll, but I'll have a bag of crisps, they're not as bad (+350 calories)&gt; Thursday - Being good, no sausage roll, even went for a run! (+150 calories)&gt; Friday - No sausage roll, but after work drinks. Had an extra G&amp;T because someone got a round in and it would have been rude to leave it (+350 calories)&gt; Saturday - not at work, no sausage rolls. Eaten sensibly (+350 calories)&gt; Sunday - taken out for a family pub lunch. Tried to stay good, but had too much and a pint of beer (+400 calories)In the next week, this person now doesn't have to cut 200 calories per day, but 257 calories per day - the sausage roll *plus* calories somewhere else. If their week plays out the same, in the third week, they have to save 314 calories per day. In the fourth, 371 calories per day *just for that month.* Compound this month on month and you can see the problem. Now if they are overeating as well, you can see how quickly weight creeps on. A more disciplined person may say:&gt; No sausage rolls this week, thats 1400 calories saved. End of week drinks is usually more than I plan, so I'll run on Thursday to get an extra 300 calories, and if I stick to my limit at the pub, I might even save 1700 calories this week. By the end of the month, the fatty could have saved 5,600 calories but instead saved 4,000. The disciplined person stuck to their drinking limit and saved 6,800 calories.
Alcohol?
But to be fair... Depends on the country. I have been an expat a good bit. Switzerland was wonderful. Hungary... Well Hungary it seemed every woman over 40 (hyperbole) was a hamplanet and every woman my age (20's) was beautiful.

Fingerling potatoes, never heard of those. Do you know how they compare nutritionally to your normal run of the mill potatoes commonly used in the US? I generally stay clear of potatoes unless they are sweet. Though that recipe sounds delicious.

eating things high in cholesterol do not lead to higher levels of cholesterol. i know i was shocked when i read the study because it goes against logic but its true. being fat leads to high cholesterol. so eating deep fried seafood won't lead to high cholesterol at all unless you get too fat from it, but then it would be the excess calories causing high cholesterol instead of the actual cholesterol.

They do get in trouble from time to time. Ireland is having an "To Abortion or not to abortion," sort of thing, and the hotel had said if you ripped off and brought in an anti-abortion poster, and tossed it away, you'd get a discount.

My food budget for my boyfriend and I is ~$320 together, which is plenty. I don't always eat &gt; two meals a day, but I have lowered appetite anyway. I often snack lightly instead of having 3 meals - a tiny bit every few hours (snacking on raw vegetables or nuts). I can't really eat more than a handful of food at a time anyway! I feel so stuffed! I cook everything from scratch, and my meals are delicious. I adore my dutch oven. How I make it work is buying whole chickens a few times a month, with lots of cheap beef bones and bone-in pork cuts too, and I'll braise the meat and then turn it into soup a few days later. We do eat a lot of rice and beans, sometimes with meat, sometimes no. We eat tons of produce, I get my broccoli and green beans frozen, kale and most other things fresh. I saute or steam most of the veg. Make use of store loyalty cards, coupons, sales, &amp; farmers markets. If I feel like I have the energy to process it all, I will buy a 35-lb meat box from my local Price Chopper, it saves a TON of money and you can get a great mix of cuts in it. Then I portion out the meat in freezer bags, some with marinade and some not, and freeze it all. 35-lbs of meat will last my bf and I over a month; I never eat more than a half pound a day, sometimes he eats up to a pound.I don't mind the "low" budget at all. We eat how people **should** eat, we can't afford junk food or sugary drinks! Both of us are disabled and we need to maximize the health we get out of the budget we have, otherwise we can't function. Edit: Location is VT for reference.

I think the biggest problem is that most diet foods have more calories by weight than the food they were intended to replace. They're just packaged in portions small enough that no one notices. Pop Tarts versus Special K pastry crisps, for example. The pastry crisps are just rebranded "diet" Pop Tarts, and they actually have more calories by weight, I believe. Weight Watchers bread is another good example. It's higher in calories than many other breads, but the slices are so small that it looks lower in calories.
"Don't be fat"
All of them equally, although I have a special grudge against SJW fatasses and pseudosocialist landwhales.
Don't be that guy taking photos of people at the gym.We all hate them, but they're at the right place. For the 80% who won't return after January, their yearly pre-paid gym subscription is subsidizing your costs.There are the 10 or 20% that will keep going and do the right thing too.
she could use some meth. if she didn't have teeth she might have a hard time eating.
Asskles.
Am I the only one who noticed her tits? Honestly I've never seen a more laughable scenario in my life. Fucking stupid jealous ham.
I think the lesbians and trannies are the worst. In most colleges, it seems to me that it's the fat ugly ones who always seem to be running the women's rights groups and protesting stupid shit

Meghan looks like she's lost weight. So much for being all about that bass.
And here I am refusing to wear a bikini just because I'm out of shape despite being skinny.
I do feel bad for some of them, like I sometimes feel bad for drug addicts or drunks ruining their lives with vice. I hope the hate reminds them that this IS A CHOICE they can stop being miserable and despised anytime they want to. Life is short, no reason to kill yourself be it cake,blow,whatever.
I love Joe goes
Hey can you pm the insta?
The fatties never cease to amaze me. They change the meaning of words, attempt to engineer male sexual attraction and now have made being below average something to strive for.
THAT RIGHT ARM.It looks like she had a really, REALLY tight rubberband left there since childhood.

People who are wholly and completely unexceptional wanting to feel special.
I like how "shame free" means "don't tell me about the truth and just pretend I'm skinny"
maybe she wants big boobies for *herself*. :3
My friend's girlfriend preaches about the wage gap all the time. Everytime she does this around me (I try to avoid her because I can't just sit by while she spews shit) I always ask her why businesses don't hire exclusively women? She then has some kind of social justice aneurysm and usually sits there silently stewing on how she can burn a cis white priveleged shitlord like myself.
I sense a breast binder under that waistcoat. Also why the fuck is is wearing suspender tights?!

I'm all for different shapes in the media but amorphous blobs of lard and cheese aren't really the angular, human forms I had in mind. Also, what's that line running down her stomach? I hope that's a post pregnancy scar...
Think she misspelled fat rolls...
I have nothing against weight watchers, but most fatties just abuse every diet they're on, and then blame the diet.
I like how you covered the beasts name with junk food.
That's next level incompetence.
hey, atleast I'm not fat
My brain cannot handle the fatlogic in this!
"Food deserts" are caused BY fat people, not the other way around ; it's supply and demand. This is why I couldn't get any frozen fruits and vegetables in bulk from Sam's Club but they DID have a trays full of 60 chocolate cupcakes a piece bc CLEARLY that's a staple families can't go without. The uptick in fatties started in the 80s and 90s when the economy was in better shape. Go to youtube and watch fast food commercials from the 60s to the 90s and you can really see when the decline started to happen and the seeds of fatlogic were planted.
The jerkstore called, they're running out of /r/fatpeoplehate subscribers.

I'm currently eating at my max maintainence : 1200-1300 cal per day and no shit or junk food, meaning no Chinese candy for me : '( ...and then in the 2nd trimester I'll increase that to an additional 100-200 calories (maybe an extra whole wheat slice with a tablespoon of peanut butter) then in the third trimester I will do 300 calories for a total of 1500/1600 a day. I'm eating only wholesome foods and I know it's a bit early to say this but there have been no cravings at all. Also I continue to workout as usual

Her and her wife both had it going on!
&gt; I think he was just trying to guilt me into letting him fuck me.I fucking hate that bullshit. It's the same thing with gay dudes setting up their Tinder profiles as women so they'll show up in straight guys' feeds. Someone on the Tinder subreddit admitted that he does that to try and catch a straight guy that might be on the fence. He used the words "guilt them into it" as well.
But those are foods that contain carbs, not carbs themselves. You could pack protein or fat into foods too, and in the case of fat you'd only need half as much for the same calories.
That's a thing?! I've had my fill, I'm not gonna check it out today lol.
I can't imagine what its like to be the only fat guy in the entire country. Must be those damn genetic issues you keep hearing about. Couldn't possibly be the rest of the country is starving.

Eugh, why does she think people want to see her stomach? So deluded
Right. I'm a 34DD. No one understands bra sizing at all. I'm a large framed girl. My doctor said I've got an unusually shaped ribcage that's kinda of wide. Take note fatties. Large frame is a 34. Not a 46. I've still got hip dips and a couple abs. But if people really want shots fired, they should figure out bra sizing. Haha

The fact that speaking out on FA gets labeled as "mysoginist" so often is one of the reasons i love FPH.

Your bmi is in the normal range.Hams are being hams
&gt;but it's a lot harder to lose weight than it is to maintain a healthy weight.Not true. Losing weight is a lot easier. It's a process that has an end goal. Say someone at 5'5" is shooting for 120. They have that number in mind, and it is attainable. There's momentum there. But when you even out and have your target weight loss and don't see those pounds coming off each week, etc. it's easy for people to think they can go back to eating how they used to, or they don't get that high from weight loss anymore. They forget that maintaining means rarely ever going above your daily caloric intake, that you have to watch the scale and pants size, that you have to go to the gym if you want a tone body, etc. I mean, that's common sense stuff right there. You can teach that to kids. But for hams, who are used to "intuitive eating" and no control...that's a big change in perspective. Many fail miserabley at it. Maintaining weight = work. Especially if you are super fit. People don't get perfectly shaped bodies and muscles out of easiness. There's a lot of effort involved. And if someone is losing weight for other's opinions, versus their own, it's going to be hard enjoying the results of healthy habits if you never fix your body for *yourself*. That's one of the big issues in America now - everyone wants that fit body, but don't want to put in maintenance work, because for some reason, people have lost all drive for any form of achievement. And when they do something, like what this girl did in the picture, they expect a freaking medal and a weekly reminder of how amazing they are. Imagine if we actually made people work for their praise...I'm sure FA hams would call that abuse, or a poisoned mentality, or something something thin privilege.

I wonder what her life is like. She's 21, does she go to college? How do her classmates treat her, do they pretend that she's not there? I can easily imagine them planning a party and she butts in in an attempt to be social and says "so guys! What's happening?" and they avert their gaze. "Is there a party?""Uh, yeah, um, no, it's like a... um. Like not a party. It's just a small study group""Oh, can I join?""Uhhh I mean it's like all full. Sorry""Oh. Okay. Um, sorry"Do her parents pity her or hate her? How often does she cry herself at night remembering all the St. Valentine days she spent utterly alone?
Just had a conversation like this in the women's locker room at my gym.One of the gym staff tells this overweight lady to start doing boxing or weight training instead of doing zumba or treadmill walking all the time. Fat girl looks pointedly at me says she doesnt want to coz she doesnt want to get all bulky. I promptly shut her down by saying women who lift weights wont ever get bulky like the men unless they take roids, our bodies dont produce male hormones that make that possible. I flex my arms in front of her fat face and show her that nonexistent jiggle. Tell her i lost the bingo wings by training my biceps and triceps. Felt good to put her in her place. Rant over.
Continental drift.
NYC is pretty shit-lordy, IMO, but now that its tourist season the streets are flooded with huge, fanny-packed mid-westerners. You can pick them out by their clothes (jorts, sneakers, t-shirts), their girth, and their inability to understand how sidewalks work
50,000 or so for me. Even if they do they're too lazy to come to the campus and find me so they have to go off what they can find online. I have nothing scandalous online and have a separate account for porn subreddits so they can have fun with trying to find anything bad on me.
&gt;I'm the one in black :)Thanks, I already identified the orca whale.
Maybe have a fat tax for having a BF% over 30% that increases exponentially.
Damn, those guys must've been desperate.
I'm so so sorry. It's horrible. what happens if they actually DO have a problem? It's crying wolf.
Well yes, but SPANX are what she should have done *that day* since she had to go out to buy new clothes, because all of hers were *obviously* destroyed in a fire. Because that is the *only goddamn reason* to go outside in that yellow disaster.
that is the perfect way to sum it up
SMH what a crazy bunch of whales
what a fucking disgusting creature.
I guess "grease" really *is* the word.
this is literally the makeup I did for my sixth grade dance.I want to make a list of everything that she did wrong, but it'd be easier to make a list of anything she did right.which is nothing.
Oh look, a planet finally at rest.
So the plan is... he keeps on sleeping with her sister while the ham pays the bills?
Sounds good to me.
Right. As much as we hate them here, many if not most of us have likely been forced to watch a friend/sibling/parent/etc destroy themselves. I know I have.

Damn I was sad reading the death thread. Glad to see you're not dead.Fuck that was a good April fools joke. Ya got us.:(Edit: wow everyone in this thread is acting like a fucking bitch. It was a joke chill the fuck out. I for one love that they did an early April fools joke. got us good.
Is she uh... disabled?
Lol. Don't even pretend that people who frequent a sub called fatpeoplehate aren't the exact kind of people who'd go brigading. Seeing as this sub is regularly on the front page now, you're squarely in the same category as r/atheism and /pcmasturrace, and everyone knows it.
At least we still have accurate tape measures and high-jumping.
that's not much to go off of. ah fuck I don't care.
To what most women who are 8 months pregnant look like, or to her Instagram account? She uses the name Sarah Stage on IG, so a search should bring her up easily. I vaguely remember seeing her say recently that the baby's weight is now 5 pounds and some change, but don't quote me on it. I know she does quite a bit of modeling (and is a spokeperson for MateFit, a kind of nutritional weight loss shake, I think.)
Let's be real guys, that's her manager who is rolling in millions of dollars. I doubt she gives a fuck.
This is just sad.
I'm serious lol.
It's like playing roulette, except even if you "win" you're still a fat sack of shit!
Hey, Wales is a beautiful country, watch your spelling mate.
Find a different therapist, mate. His job is to help you, NOT to judge you. You decide what you want in a partner, not your mother, your brother, or your idiot therapist.
I've also called this out in the past. I really hate to compare fat *humans* to whales, seals, manatees, cows, pigs, etc. Those animals are what they are. They are beautiful in their own way. This is why I advocate calling them amoebas: they are shapeless, amorphous blobs, and I don't feel bad about calling them that (as an animal lover).
I was explicit with this with my gf awhile after we started dating when it was clear it'd be a longer term thing. I looked at her and said, "I'm serious, if you get fat, I'm leaving you. I will no longer find you attractive and you would have demonstrated you don't care for yourself."She didn't get fat, but I can't fathom the people who think it's okay to get fat after they've found a long term partner. So much inconsideration.
Whaaaat. You look fantastic!

Calm yourself. I was born shortly after the USSR collapsed. Also I am very fucking well aware of how to use a search engine.
No, because those stories are told by shitlords, and I'm more willing to believe them.
I do. I told her to do something one day and she made an excuse and was like "I'll do it in a minute" so I literally stood there staring her down for a solid minute until she got her fat ass up.
NPO?
To be honest i eat just like the first half i eat fast food at least once a day and just eat snacks and drink beer non stop, I am 6'2 and weigh around 140-150 pounds i have no idea why i dont really drink soda, but i do shit twice a day once in the morning and usually once around 3-4 o clock, (work is very boring yes i time it)
I was slightly exaggerating for effect
Only half right

I work with a woman who is 30, 5'4 and at least 225 lbs. I go to the gym 3 times a week and she has more workout clothes than I do. She brings them to work and makes a big show of putting them on, filling her water bottle, getting her headphones in, etc. Then she walks at a fucking snail's pace up and down three flights of stairs a couple of times.
Ok guys, I'm going to click the link and try to make it through. Send a search party if I'm not back in 10 minutes.EDIT: Made it. I need a therapist. 87- Oh god it has more pit hair than me!

When your panties stop looking like a "V" and start looking like a "W," it's time to put the fork down. Actually it's probably time to put the fork down 10 years ago.
Wow!! I love it. Completely proves she is a liar!

WHY do they need to make up new names for things? Foga, Fatshion, etc... I wonder if it's because deep down, they know that what they're doing doesn't pass for real yoga. And no matter how "cute" they try to dress, they know they still look like sacks of shit.
A ham harmony
That's so funny.
In the event the danger were real, the fatass would be trampled to floor salad.
Talking about what to eat and how to work out isn't as fascinating of a conversation as you might think.Insulting people? That's good old fashioned fun.
Looks like a fat pile of shit full of himself.
It reminds me more of one of those zombies in Left 4 Dead 2. Except those ones could actually run. *Edit* It looks like a cross between a Spitter and a Boomer. URLThird from the left and second from the right.
I can relate and agree with that sentiment. Growing up my parents never fed my sister or I fast food. It was just something we didn't eat. Not really because it was unhealthy, but because home cooked food just tastes better and because we lived a little ways out of town.Now that I'm older I'm really happy we didn't because fast food is something I never even think about eating. It isn't an option. Not because I actively avoid it, but because I forget it's something I *could* go and eat. Plus, I never want or crave it which is a benefit as well. I really think that has allowed me to reach my fitness goals much easier than some of my friends.
Well, that made me gag. You have ruined parmesan.
Liraglutide is already approved for type 2 diabetes, it just happens to be one of several diabetes medications that also causes weight loss. It works by increasing insulin secretion. That being said, it definitely won't make up for overeating.

You know, I really, really, *really* hope that one day you realize you're a fat-ass and that you need to do something about it.Then when you're *truly* as fit as you seem to think you are now, you can come on back and hate on the fatties with us.Until that day, [you can't sit with us](URL
Well yeah, but it'd be a good comment... peniswizard drops a similar line when he bans for fat sympathyIts just quite common is all
more evidence that fatasses have subhuman brains like the sow in the 3rd pic. the reason stores don't carry the fatass size is because there are so many fatasses. they can't comprehend basic supply and demand.
It is absolutely horrifying... That the number is so low. I'd hope for 90% trying to fight this acceptance bullshit
I'm definitely in the same camp as you as far as comebacks are concerned. You can't win an argument with an idiot so it's best to just frustrate them or talk to them like you would a child.

Another fucking moron who has no idea about how the body works (surprise surprise!). Says she's lactose intolerant, then turns right around (obviously not literally) and says she puts oreos in a big glass of milk (where do you think the milk goes, dumbass?) and then puts ice cream on it.Okay, so you're lactose intolerant and eat cookies, milk and ice cream. How can anyone be this stupid?
That's an iHam XXL.
Based mod protects us from fat logic.
Well he's dumber than he looks for being a fatty and trying to hide it, as well as for marrying Tessie. But...&gt; Being fat isn't only seen as a failure to visually conform to societies standards, it's constantly linked to a failure in discipline/effortI really can't argue with that. He's 100% correct there. If being fat was simply about the visual insult to my eyeballs, I could begrudge them of it without hating them. But the ham's appearance is a symptom of its own gluttony and laziness, which is what I hate about them.
I will fight you about it!
She's the DUFF.
I dunno, seems she went from a soft 5 to a 2.

Fatties quoting The Princess Diaries. It's not a bad thing to live by.... Except when you're reduced to saying it to others because then that just means that you're trying to convince yourself and not them.

Did I somehow click myself in to North Korea? Everyone who wants should be allowed to take the elevators, it's a fucking moving room proving the evolution of human engineering, what kind of force hippie earth hour bullshit is this? Forcing fat people to use our transport systems is just as equally bad as fat people trying to force you to accept their beetus. The problem isn't whether or not they are allowed to use the elevators or not, the problem is them choosing not to do it with the cost of their own health, and forcing them to do something will just worsen the situation. Anyone of you ever tried forcing a kid to eat their vegetables? Not really the best tactic now is it?I have a perfectly fit body, I train and eat healthy just so I can slack of and take the easy way when I don't feel like over straining myself. If you have so little self discipline someone has to force you to live healthy you should fucking kill yourself. And I don't mean that in an regular online rage kinda way, if you really lack that little self discipline there is no way you will enjoy life, you might just do yourself that favor now before you break your leg and someone else has to put you down.
You can't always predict when your child is going to be hungry and the world definitely doesn't stop when you have an infant. If you're out grocery shopping and your baby gets hungry, it's time to feed them. It's honestly not a big deal, it's not for sexual attention, it's literally to meet the need or their new baby. I don't think it's a big deal.
No Patrick...
People watching and ripping on the Disney Hams is one of me and my girlfriends favorite things to do at the park hahaha we also play the game of who can spot the first ham in the Minnie Mouse ears, and we usually don't even make it out of the parking structure with that one.
I am curious. What does doxxing do to someone who has nothing to lose and no employers?
STOP USING SPRINT!
Take the focus away from the lard I suppose. Someone should tell her that it's not working.She'll immediately respond by calling you a fat shamer and post shitty tubblr-angled images on instaham with the tess monster tag.
So is childbirth.
There's not enough chlorine in that pool to make me get in if there's one of those in there. Yuck.
I can't do the soda and chocolate but anything else... why not
That head band is cutting off circulation to her brain. She has no clue about fashion, she's never heard of a hankerchief hem? She should just stick to what she knows, mass quantities of food!

There's this weird shaped chick I see frequently out at clubs. She's unhealthy fat-ish. We're calling her the toddler because she is shaped exactly like a toddler. Short arms, chunky belly, and she stands like a damn toddler. It's awful.

So she did a half of a half-assed push up and called it a 'pose' and thinks she looks like a 'cute baby seal'? Are we sure it shouldn't say she 'ate a cute baby seal'?And we should really think about seal feelings here...I'm sure they're offended being compared to that hamslug.
You're doing gods work.
Bonus points name that movie.
Dr. Nowzarden is my favorite shitlord. This chick was the Half-ton Mom, she was on a one-off documentary episode before they started the My 600lb Life series. He's been cutting open fatties longer than most of them have been eating.
Well being *sassy* is her main way of expressing her *amazing personality* after all~
Exactly. I started losing weight then found this sub. Really glad I did because you're all an inspiration for me to stay healthy. Being healthy is really easy and honestly fun and if it weren't for this sub I wouldn't have pursued my dream to be a personal trainer. So thank you shitlord/ladies!

What I dislike the most about fat people is that they can be normal but they're choosing instead to be awful wastes of space and resources. It seems like you believe people can't change. But that is patently false.
Hey you just described tumblr! Cya later fatty.
It's an insult to people with legitimate problems. I've seen first hand the issues people face with hypothyroid, gastroparesis, and liver damage, and it can be soul crushing. Fatties will come up with any excuse they can so they don't have to feel bad about themselves, but they have no idea about the actual struggles and hardships people face. Fat fucks are one of the biggest thorns in my side at work, for a host of different reasons. We'll treat them and do our best to get them well (which is oxymoronic), but we sure as hell don't like them.
Yeah, calling her a fatass wasn't based on one meal transaction, but rather the aggregate of looking like a slovenly, sloppy sideshow carnie for the last decade.

Well to be fair, most of the fat people I know are really fucking stupid
A friend of a friend thought that she would lose weight by eating normally but also drinking a protein shake.Her diet didn't last long.
Honestly couldn't tell.
Actually.. I kind of did. But I've been stalking fatpeoplehate for weeks and it was time I made an alt so as to be a more vocal, participating shitlady.
You &amp; I both know that 90% of what she eats doesn't go in her logs."oh 6 oreos? They don't really count because it was just once only, so i won't enter them here"
That looks like pasta.
Fat Acceptance... I accept that you choose to be fat... I accept that you have a choice to die by complications for obesity... I do not accept that I have to condone the lifestyle or force myself to think that, big is beautiful.
I know, it´s fucking unbelievable.I can´t count how many times people have said shit like that to me - things that are downright offensive! - in a concerned voice (because yeah, that makes it so much better.)
You've got a pm proving otherwise.
Sure, nothing wrong with that.Best bulking food I found was Greek yoghurt, since I could slam down 500g a day easy.
Jez, I wear a 32 and that tends to be the lowest on the rack most places I go aside from maybe 1 or 2 30s. 25-26 life must be pretty rough.
Are you implying you don't?
She barely eats. with her genetics it's like 800 calories.. She'd literally have to starve herself to lose a bit of weight.
Amazing. Just....amazing.The herpes really skeeved me out tho. Couldn't believe when the one dude kissed her.
The healthiest hair is achieved by only washing it every 3 to 4 days. Seems gross and contrary to what we've been taught but it's true. One of my grad program advisers specializes in hair and was talking about this just last week.
She's pretty damn close to quadruple cleavage. And losing a leg.
It was bad to start with, but looks like their only activities are eating and sleeping since 05, who is funding this?
She's obeast because she eats too much.
Mmmm faith hill.

Eh, I would be surprised if that wasn't photoshopped a little bit. That being said, it's not much if any - probably touchups to her skin rather than trying to make her skinnier. It is pretty sad how they assume that body type is so unobtainable. It doesn't even really take that much work.
Oh I know for a fact there are lots of older shitlords out there! I know many! You may be happy to learn that even though I am in my late twenties (not 26 or 27) and the fat kid in our school was relentlessly bullied for being fat. One hilarious jackass asked him once if his girlfriend titty fucked him. I really doubt it has changed even now, kids are fucking MEAN man! Like so damn mean. They don't have filters, they don't give fucks and when you hit the teenager stage you become straight up malicious in matters like that. I doubt haes has any fucking effect on kids these days, except for the fats. Imagine the names you could use for haes. Huge Asses Eat Sundaes, Hungry at Every Second, Haggard and Exotic Species. Fuck that was like 20 seconds, imagine a teenager.
It saddens me to see that this abomination exists in my city.
Big Green has got the right idea. The others' "bikini" bottoms are lost in the folds and makes them look naked. They should be arrested for public indecency. On that note, what happens when a tubby is too big to fit in a police car?
I guess that's one way to lose 50lbs...
Ha, I'll do some digging. There is SO much more.
I bet she brags how she can "still fit in her middle school clothes" too.

This builds onto the tobogganing article it also talks about a lady trying to get oak trees cut down to prevent acorns from giving peanut allergies! Sorry I was a fat kid when I was 8-13 I was bullied only because I had many friends. It did toughen me up and then I kicked the shit out of one guy and guess what nobody messed with me again I had 20 inch arms from pull ups and curling barbells. I never was a scraper but I could take punches with no problems. But seriously these stupid idiots that come up with all these laws or ban things need a reality check.

Thank you! The BMI rule makes me self-conscious. At 5'6", adding a few pounds of muscle really moves the number up fast :/
*I* know it's fake. Jesus Christ. It's obvious enough even without that wacky contrast analysis. Did you even read what I wrote?
I would not be surprised if in the not at all distint future hospital staff, including doctors, are told by management to never mention patients size, regardless of relevance to health. Probably happening now to some degree. The very presence of staff or just other patients or family of patients who are a healthy weight likely "triggers" or whatever bullcrap that forces the "triggered" ham to make an outrageous complaint about being fat-shamed by the site of people who are not hamplanets and demand food to correct such horrible injustice.

The bodies in media are not natural? Are fit and healthy women suddenly made of plastic or something?
People keep mistaking us for another fatty sub that deals with some degree of related logic, where fatties are allowed, and allowed to talk about how they're working on their losses even if they're not. Its not kosher here. Neither is sticking up for hams, ie, declaring that you would fuck one, or its 'pretty cute despite all the fat.'Ex-fatties can be here once they're not... well... fatties. I might be leaving briefly, because my medical shit is getting out of control and I am all out banned from exercise and my usual diet until my GI issues/ligament issues get figured out. Trying to stay in shape but 1200 calories is haaaaaaaaarrd. I need my gym :(
Only in my hands.
i can actually hear them getting fatter...
Listen here you fucking moron I'm going to drop science on you:When you eat food, it goes into your body, then you have to **BURN** all the calories through exercise, but nobody wants to do exercise, because exercise makes you fatter.So you can bypass this by **BURNING** the food before you eat it. That will **BURN** all the calories out of the food, and all you have left is the delicious taste of your buttered mayo ice cream snickers bar bacon sandwich with minimal calories! Yum!
Oh, don't tell me how it ends! I haven't gotten to the finale yet!
I was going to have a protein powder and sour apple feast (down 7 lbs in 9 days, HAES numbnuts, and all without being able to do rigorous exercise like competing for a national dance championship) but instead I'm going for a walk and see if there are any babies or kittens to play with outside. It's like when I was hungry as a kid between meals - my caregiver would hand me a gross-out horror novel instead of a beetus treat.
She can't have many hobbies outside of eating. That is what gets me sometimes, how much they prioritize eating, and how degenerative other parts of their life must be. I enjoy a good meal, but the best parts of life happen outside of stuffing your face. Fat people never get to experience that.
I'm an equal opportunity hater. I don't care if you're male, female, or any combination of the two...All fat people are gross.Although people who have extremely overweight kids and pets deserve more hate, because they allowed someone they are responsible for to get overweight
&gt;...for the obese there is a kind of release from this obligation, from all pride of representationThere is a kind of curious liberty in not giving a shit. But you could tease that word, obligation, to family, health, community. Also, appreciate the grad school flashback... Now I'm triggered.

That happened to my sister a lot growing up. Obeast day-care workers tried to tell my mom that it was because she was too thin. My mom being a proper shitlady told them to fuck right off. (and stopped sending us to that daycare)

Fat increases pre-existing risk to develop conditions. ALL OF THEM. Our genetic makeup, diet and environment all contribute to increase or decrease said risk. Some people are more susceptible to diabetes, some cancer, others hypertension, some poor bastard everything. There's no absolutes, everyone has some chance to get the disease I listed. The differences is to what probability. If person in the picture already had 10% chance, that little beer belly might bump it up to 15%. (not actual numbers, just examples). To be fair, most doctors won't care about that small pudge. They have seen worse shit. Another morbidly fun example: Already prone to PCOS? If you're obese, enjoy having it carpet bomb your ovaries. Fit Dad has diabetes at age 60? Well obese you is gonna get it at 30.
The hambeasts thankfully have some shame around me and don't comment on portions and food choices. And my immediate team is mostly average. Certainly not dit... But they control their appetites
are we all looking at the same picture? i find her really ugly-looking even in the before pics :o i mean at least they werent fat but...
I don't care how bad it would feel to hold it all in, I would never EVER go into a Wal-Mart restroom.EDIT: that said, I rarely go there at all if I can help it
It's well known that BMI has a bit of an accuracy problem with tall people and men. That being said, I played Division 1 college football and was considered "obese" by BMI standards because I was a 6'0" 225lb strong safety/linebacker. I was not shredded at 6% body fat (more around 8-12% depending on the time of the season), but certainly I wouldn't consider myself obese in the sense of fatties as we call them today.That's not to say I wasn't at an increased health risk because of my weight. BMI simply states that at your given size, you are more likely to develop health problems than someone of a "normal" BMI. Finally, people should stop using the BMI inaccuracies to justify their obesity. Very few people are BMI obese while not being at least a little bit overweight and flabby.
Of course fat tastes good. The issue is that it's fucking ridiculous to compare steak to a woman. I don't like my steak alive, or with eyeballs or hair. I don't like my women seared on the outside and served with an internal temperature of 125F.
Zero fucks given. Just a disgusting "human"?
Well the song was about a chain.. so yes it does.
An ACL tear.
"I'm so sorry ham... I mean mam, ScootyPuff is just the manufacturer's model name, if you'd like I can see if we sell any from a different range, maybe one with a more 'appropriate' name. How about a HamTransport? Or a LardLoader, we are running a 25% off promotion on both the BlobKart and the WhaleTugger."
First time I'm reading a post here that I couldn't finish. She sounds like a half-intelligent person... no, scratch that. She can spell and it ends there. All her bitching and moaning has a BUT THIS, and BUT THAT. Excuse after excuse after excuse. Deport her to Ethiopia and see if she continues to have glucose problems.
actually, being obese either with fat or with muscle is bad for you since its taxing for your heart to send blood to the extremities. be swole, but not too swole.
Wales, definitely wales.
